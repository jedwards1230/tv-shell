//! tv-shell-host — a thin, cross-platform sidecar that answers two questions
//! for the tv-shell TV client: "what Steam games are installed?" and "launch
//! this one." Moonlight remains the stream engine; this service never touches
//! Sunshine config, so other Moonlight clients are unaffected.
//!
//! Endpoints (`/library`, `/launch`, `/open-bpm`, `/quit`, `/sleep`, `/status`,
//! `/capabilities` require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; `/art/{appid}` is
//! intentionally PUBLIC — see below):
//!   GET  /library      → { games: [LibraryEntry, ...] }   (VDF/ACF enumeration)
//!   POST /launch       { appid }  → { ok: true }  (navigates Big Picture to the
//!                                                  game's page; user presses Play)
//!   POST /open-bpm     (no body)  → { ok: true }  (opens Big Picture's HOME
//!                                                  screen — no game selected)
//!   POST /quit         { appid }  → { ok, appid, reason }  (gracefully terminates
//!                                                  the running game — SIGTERM to
//!                                                  its process group, like Steam's

//!                                                  200 — when nothing matched)
//!   POST /sleep        (no body)  → { ok, reason }  (suspends the host to RAM;
//!                                                    REFUSED with { ok: false,

//!                                                    a stream is live)
//!   GET  /status       → { version, running_appid, streaming }
//!   GET  /capabilities → { node_id, kind, agent_version, platform, features }
//!                        (what this node declares it can do — see `capabilities`)
//!   GET  /art/{appid}  → image/jpeg of the local Steam library art for `appid`,
//!                        or 404. PUBLIC (no bearer): cover art isn't sensitive
//!                        and QML's `Image.source` can't send an Authorization
//!                        header. `appid` is parsed as `u32` (non-numeric ⇒ 404),
//!                        so no raw string ever reaches a filesystem path.
//!
//! Config (env; legacy `GAME_SHELL_*` names honored as a fallback):
//!   TV_SHELL_HOST_TOKEN — bearer token. If unset AND `TV_SHELL_HOST_BIND` is
//!                         loopback-only, a CSPRNG token is generated and
//!                         logged on startup. If unset and the bind is
//!                         non-loopback, **the sidecar refuses to start** —
//!                         :47995 accepts `/launch`, `/quit`, and `/sleep`
//!                         (a machine-wide suspend), so serving that
//!                         unauthenticated on the LAN is not a safe default.
//!   TV_SHELL_HOST_PORT  — listen port (default 47995).
//!   TV_SHELL_HOST_BIND  — listen address (default 0.0.0.0 = all LAN ifaces).
//!
//! Optionally the sidecar also publishes its state to MQTT and accepts a few
//! commands there — additive, never a replacement for the HTTP routes above (the
//! QML shell's Steam widget depends on them). It is off unless
//! `TV_SHELL_MQTT_BROKER` is set; see [`mqtt`] for the full env surface.
