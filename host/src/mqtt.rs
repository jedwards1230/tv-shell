//! MQTT client for the desktop sidecar — publishes this machine's state to a
//! broker and accepts a small set of remote commands.
//!
//! # One machine, one device
//!
//! This process runs on **the desktop**: ONE physical machine that dual-boots
//! CachyOS and Windows 11. Only one OS is up at a time, and both boots share a
//! single `device_id`, a single Home Assistant device, and a single MQTT
//! username. That is why [`settings_from_env`] **fails closed** when a broker is
//! configured without an explicit `TV_SHELL_MQTT_DEVICE_ID`: deriving the id from
//! the hostname or the OS would split one machine into two devices that alternate
//! as it reboots.
//!
//! # Why `published_at`, `seq` and the floor heartbeat exist
//!
//! A client can keep "publishing" into a **half-open socket** long after the
//! broker gave up on it and fired its Last Will. That happened on this broker for
//! 13.5 hours: every consumer read `unavailable` while the publisher's own logs
//! looked perfectly healthy. Availability cannot express *"connected, but nothing
//! is arriving"* — a `published_at` that stops advancing and a `seq` that stops
//! incrementing can. The publish loop therefore emits on change **and** on a floor
//! heartbeat (default 30 s) so those two fields always move on a healthy link.
//! They are the point of the design, not bookkeeping.
//!
//! # Configuration — environment only
//!
//! The sidecar has no config file, and `brand::config_dir()` is unusable here: on
//! Windows neither `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` nor `HOME` is normally set, so it resolves to
//! a CWD-relative path. **This module never calls it.** Every knob is an env var,
//! read through [`tv_shell_protocol::brand::env`] so the legacy `GAME_SHELL_*`
//! prefix keeps working:
//!
//! | var | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | `TV_SHELL_MQTT_BROKER` | `mqtts://host:8883` or `mqtt://host:1883`. **Unset ⇒ MQTT off entirely.** |
//! | `TV_SHELL_MQTT_DEVICE_ID` | explicit device id. **Required when the broker is set.** |
//! | `TV_SHELL_MQTT_USERNAME` | broker username (both-or-neither with the password) |
//! | `TV_SHELL_MQTT_PASSWORD` | the password itself, not a path — Windows has no mode bits |
//! | `TV_SHELL_MQTT_CA_FILE` | path to a PEM CA bundle; unset ⇒ platform roots |
//! | `TV_SHELL_MQTT_HEARTBEAT_SECS` | floor heartbeat, default 30 |
//! | `TV_SHELL_MQTT_KEEPALIVE_SECS` | MQTT keepalive, default 60 |
//!
//! Deployment: on Linux these extend `~/.config/tv-shell-host/host.env` (0600,
//! Ansible-managed, `no_log`); on Windows they extend the existing per-user
//! environment variables, which are ACL-protected rather than mode-bit protected
//! and are readable by any process running as that user. That is **the same trust
//! model as the bearer token already deployed there — no regression** — but it is
//! not parity with Linux. There is no reload path either: the process reads the
//! environment once, so any change (including a credential rotation) needs a
//! restart of the sidecar.
