# Headless QML unit tests (QtQuickTest) for the shell's components.
#
# Quickshell-free components can be exercised with the standard Qt qmltestrunner
# under QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen — no compositor, no GPU. The trick is the
# import graph: production components reference singletons (Theme, Units, …) that
# pull in Quickshell, which qmltestrunner can't load. So we assemble a throwaway
# `components` module from:
#   - hand-written STUB singletons (tests/qml/stubs)  — the shim layer
#   - the REAL components under test, copied verbatim  — zero drift
# and point qmltestrunner's import path at it. See tests/qml/README.md.
