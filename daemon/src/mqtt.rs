//! MQTT state publisher + command surface.
//!
//! The daemon opens its **own** broker connection so it carries its **own** Last
//! Will. Availability is then a fact the broker asserts when our socket dies —
//! not something a consumer has to probe for. No other tv-shell process proxies
//! for this one.
//!
//! ## Frozen topic + identity contract
//!
//! Do not change any of these strings; consumers (Home Assistant discovery,
//! retained state) are bound to them. The builders live in
//! [`tv_shell_protocol::mqtt`] so the daemon and the desktop sidecar cannot drift.
//!
//! ```text
//! tv-shell/<device_id>/state                        retained     device -> broker
//! tv-shell/<device_id>/avail                        retained     LWT: "online" / "offline"
//! tv-shell/<device_id>/cmd/<name>                   NOT retained broker -> device
//! homeassistant/device/tv-shell-<device_id>/config  retained     discovery
//!
//! HA device identifier : tv-shell-<device_id>
//! entity unique_id     : tv-shell-<device_id>-<entity_key>
//! ```
//!
//! This daemon's `device_id` is **explicitly configured, never derived** — not
//! the hostname, not the IP, not anything the box can guess about itself. See
//! [`crate::daemon_config::DaemonConfig::mqtt_device_id`].
//!
//! ## Why `published_at` / `seq` / the floor heartbeat exist
//!
//! A client can keep "publishing" into a **half-open socket** long after the
//! broker gave up on it and fired its Last Will. That happened on this broker for
//! 13.5 hours: every consumer read `unavailable` while the publisher's own logs
//! looked perfectly healthy. **Availability did not catch it** — availability
//! cannot express *"connected, but nothing is arriving"*.
//!
//! A `published_at` that stops advancing and a `seq` that stops incrementing can,
//! but only if the publisher is guaranteed to keep publishing when nothing has
//! changed. That guarantee is the **floor heartbeat** ([`MqttSettings::heartbeat`],
//! default 30 s): the publish loop is emit-on-change *plus* a floor, so a frozen
//! `published_at` is unambiguous evidence of a wedge rather than a quiet house.
//!
//! [`crate::service_health::run`] is the emit-on-change precedent this follows,
//! but it has **no** floor heartbeat — the floor here is a genuine addition, and
//! the whole point of the design. Do not "simplify" it away.
//!
//! ## There is no config-reload path
//!
//! `DaemonConfig::load()` runs once into a `OnceLock` and `watch.rs` watches
//! `settings.json` only. Any `[mqtt]` change — **including a credential
//! rotation** — requires a **daemon restart**, and a daemon restart hands the CEC
//! adapter off to whatever grabs it next (see the CEC notes in `CLAUDE.md`).
//! Rotating the MQTT password is therefore an outage-adjacent operation, not a
//! config edit.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! Three cooperating tasks, all fire-and-forget and all cancelled by the shared
//! [`CancellationToken`]:
//!
//! 1. **the event loop** ([`run`]'s body) — drives `EventLoop::poll()` and does
//!    nothing else that can block, so protocol keepalives are never starved.
//! 2. **the publisher** — owns every outbound publish/subscribe. Keeping the
//!    sends off the polling task is what makes a full request channel impossible
//!    to deadlock on: the event loop is always draining it.
//! 3. **the command executor** — runs one incoming command at a time off a small
//!    bounded channel, so a slow command (`restart-shell` shells out to
//!    `systemctl`) can neither stall the protocol loop nor spawn unboundedly.
//!
//! Cross-platform on purpose — this module is **not** `cfg`-gated in `lib.rs`.
//! Gating it would drop it from macOS `cargo test` coverage, and everything it
//! calls ([`crate::ipc::dispatch_dbus`], [`crate::bridge_core`],
//! [`crate::shell_state`], [`crate::display_owner`]) is already cross-platform.
