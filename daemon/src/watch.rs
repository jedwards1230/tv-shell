//! File-watch actor (Linux-only): watches `~/.config/game-shell/settings.json`
//! for external modifications and notifies the input runtime via a dedicated
//! [`tokio::sync::Notify`] channel (not the global event broadcast bus).
//!
//! **Design**: the daemon is the sole writer of `settings.json` (via
//! `config::set_config` and `config::save_bindings`). Those functions call
//! `config::note_self_write()` before every `std::fs::write`, bumping a
//! module-level `AtomicU64`. The watch task records the generation after each
//! handled batch. On a debounced inotify event it re-reads the counter: if the
//! generation advanced since the last emit, the write was daemon-originated and
//! the event is suppressed. External edits never bump the counter, so they
//! always fire.
//!
//! **Directory watch**: atomic write-then-rename external editors (editors,
//! `echo >`, `ansible.copy`) replace the inode. Watching the FILE directly
//! goes deaf after the first rename; we watch the **parent directory** and
//! filter events whose path basename == `settings.json`.
//!
//! **Degradation**: if the watcher cannot be established (e.g. inotify
//! unavailable), we log a warning and return — live-reload degrades to
//! restart-required, matching the behaviour of the D-Bus actors when their
//! service is absent.
