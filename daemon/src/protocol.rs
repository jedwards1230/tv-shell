//! IPC wire protocol: parsing commands and rendering responses/events.
//!
//! The wire format is **newline-delimited bare UTF-8 text** in both directions
//! (see `docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md`), NOT JSON — only the `get-bindings` *response*
//! body is a compact JSON object. The QML client talks to this exact format,
//! so every string here stayed byte-for-byte compatible with the former
//! `gamepad-input.py` (since deleted) — the QML client is unchanged.
//!
//! `Command`/`Event` are typed enums so the daemon's `match` arms are
//! compiler-checked exhaustive; the (de)serialization to/from legacy text lives
//! here rather than via `#[serde]` (serde-tagged JSON would change the wire and
//! break QML).

///   `<target>` against the closed [`INTENT_OVERLAY_TARGETS`] set; unknown
///   overlay targets are rejected with `error:unknown intent '<name>'`.
/// - `app:<id>` — launch the local app whose `wmClass` (StartupWMClass) is
///   `<id>`. The daemon accepts any non-empty `<leaf>`; the live app list lives
///   in QML, so an absent app is a graceful no-op in QML (logged, no crash).
///
/// A name with an empty leaf (`settings:`, `overlay:`, `app:`) or an unknown
/// namespace (`foo:bar`) returns `false` → the daemon replies
/// `error:unknown intent '<name>'`.
