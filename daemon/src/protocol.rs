//! IPC wire protocol: parsing commands and rendering responses/events.
//!
//! The wire format is **newline-delimited bare UTF-8 text** in both directions
//! (see `docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md`), NOT JSON — only the `get-bindings` *response*
//! body is a compact JSON object. The QML client talks to this exact format,
//! so every string here stayed byte-for-byte compatible with the former
//! `gamepad-input.py` (since deleted) — the QML client is unchanged.

//! `Command`/`Event` are typed enums so the daemon's `match` arms are
//! compiler-checked exhaustive; the (de)serialization to/from legacy text lives
//! here rather than via `#[serde]` (serde-tagged JSON would change the wire and
