//! Typed daemon configuration: `~/.config/tv-shell/config.toml`.
//!
//! Replaces the old `daemon.env` `KEY=VALUE` file that `tv-shell-session.sh`
//! sourced into the environment. The daemon now reads a typed TOML document
//! directly, so the config surface is parsed once, validated at startup, and
//! never leaks the bearer token into the process environment (where any child
//! subprocess — grim, quickshell — would inherit it).
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! ```toml
//! [panel]                     # tv-shell-panel web control panel (its own binary)
//! enabled = true              #   the panel serves when its systemd unit runs
//! bind = "127.0.0.1:8091"     #   panel listen address (LAN-only, no auth in v1)
//!
//! [http]                      # LAN HTTP control bridge (opt-in)
//! bind = "127.0.0.1:8089"     #   absent ⇒ bridge off
//! auth_enabled = true         #   default true; only disable on a trusted LAN
//! token_file = "~/.config/tv-shell/http-token"  # 0600; the shared bearer token
//!
//! [mcp]                       # MCP server (opt-in; needs --features mcp)
//! bind = "127.0.0.1:8090"     #   absent ⇒ off; shares [http].token_file + auth
//! dev = false                 #   dev tools (build/restart/deploy) — keep off in prod
//! allowed_hosts = ["my-host.local"]   # Host-header allowlist (DNS-rebind guard)
//!
//! [cec]                       # HDMI-CEC lifecycle (needs --features cec)
//! lifecycle = false
//!
//! [plex]                      # Plex home-screen widget (optional)
//! url = "http://plex:32400"
//! token_file = "~/.config/tv-shell/plex-token"   # or: token = "…"
//!
//! [steam]                     # Steam library row (optional)
//! url = "http://gaming-pc:47995"
//! token_file = "~/.config/tv-shell/steam-token"  # or: token = "…"
//!
//! [dev]                       # operator escape hatch
//! allow_insecure_lan = false  # see validate(): permit LAN + dev + no-auth on purpose
//! ```
//!
//! ## Security
//!
//! The shared bearer token is **by reference only** (`[http].token_file`), never
//! inline, and the referenced file must be private (mode `0600`). A
//! missing/empty/world-readable token file means "no token", which — with auth
//! enabled — fails closed (all requests 401).
//!
//! [`DaemonConfig::validate`] REFUSES to run with the dangerous combination of a
//! non-loopback bind + dev tools + effectively-disabled auth (for BOTH the HTTP
//! bridge and the MCP server), unless the operator has explicitly opted in with
//! `[dev].allow_insecure_lan = true`.
//!
//! Cross-platform: pure parsing/validation, unit-tested on every host.
