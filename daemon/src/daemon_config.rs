//! Typed daemon configuration: `~/.config/tv-shell/config.toml`.
//!
//! Replaces the old `daemon.env` `KEY=VALUE` file that `tv-shell-session.sh`
//! sourced into the environment. The daemon now reads a typed TOML document
//! directly, so the config surface is parsed once, validated at startup, and
//! never leaks the bearer token into the process environment (where any child
//! subprocess — grim, quickshell — would inherit it).
//!
//! ## Layout
//!

//! bind = "127.0.0.1:8089"     #   absent ⇒ bridge off
//! auth_enabled = true         #   default true; only disable on a trusted LAN
//! token_file = "~/.config/tv-shell/http-token"  # 0600; the shared bearer token

//! ```
//!
//! ## Security
//!
//! The shared bearer token is **by reference only** (`[http].token_file`), never
//! inline, and the referenced file must be private (mode `0600`). A
//! missing/empty/world-readable token file means "no token", which — with auth
//! enabled — fails closed (all requests 401).
//!
//! [`DaemonConfig::validate`] REFUSES to run with the dangerous combination of a
//! non-loopback bind + dev tools + effectively-disabled auth (for BOTH the HTTP
//! bridge and the MCP server), unless the operator has explicitly opted in with
//! `[dev].allow_insecure_lan = true`.
//!
//! Cross-platform: pure parsing/validation, unit-tested on every host.
