//! Linux input runtime: the single owner of all mutable daemon state.
//!
//! Runs on its own OS thread (a current-thread tokio runtime, set up in
//! `main.rs`) so real-time input timing — 60 Hz mouse, stick auto-repeat,
//! hold/combo timers — stays off the IPC server's scheduler. The IPC server
//! messages this runtime over the `Control` channel; timers are spawned tasks
//! that post `Internal` messages back to the one select loop, which keeps state
//! mutation single-owner (no `Arc<Mutex>` across `.await`).
//!
//! ## Fleet model (Phase 4)
//!
//! The runtime owns a [`Fleet`] of physical pads keyed by raw fd. Each
//! [`PadDevice`] carries its own input state — held buttons, stick calibration,
//! per-pad timers, a stable player slot (#101) — so multiple pads run
//! independently. Shared resources (the virtual uinput keyboard/mouse, the
//! broadcast bus, the controller DB, the remap table, the capture state) live in
//! [`Shared`], borrowed by every per-pad method.
//!
//! Combo / Home-hold detection is **per-pad-complete** (`[critic P1]`): a combo
//! fires only when a *single* pad holds the full key set. The fleet-level timers
//! check, at fire time, whether *any* pad still holds the complete combo, so two
//! pads pressing Home simultaneously produce one `intent:home-hold`, never a
//! double-fire, and two pads each holding *half* a combo never trigger it. For a
//! single connected pad this is byte-identical to the pre-fleet behavior.
//!
//! This was ported from the former `input/gamepad-input.py` (since deleted —
//! this daemon is now the sole backend). The wire-facing strings
//! and pure decision logic live in `protocol`/`config`/`state` (and are tested
//! on any host); this module is the evdev/uinput glue, exercised by CI on Linux
//! and on the target device.
