//! Shared MQTT wire types: the state envelope, device identity, and the Home
//! Assistant device-based discovery document.
//!
//! Two tv-shell processes publish to MQTT, each over its **own** connection so
//! each carries its **own** Last Will:
//!
//! | device | `device_id` | crate | `status` shape |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | the TV client | configured, e.g. `tv-box` | `tv-shell-input` (`daemon/`) | [`ShellSnapshot`] |
//! | the gaming PC (dual-boot, ONE machine) | `desktop` | `tv-shell-host` (`host/`) | [`crate::StatusResponse`] |
//!
//! One retained message on one topic per device, so a consumer never sees a torn
//! read across topics. The two devices share the [`StateEnvelope`] but **not** the
//! `status` type: the host sidecar already has a canonical three-field
//! [`crate::StatusResponse`], while the daemon's `GET /status` body is assembled
//! ad-hoc from daemon-local structs and therefore needs its own shape here.
//!
//! Pure serde — no clock, no I/O, no time crate. `published_at` is supplied by the
//! caller (see [`StateEnvelope`] for why that field is load-bearing).
//!
//! ## Availability is per-entity, in three tiers
//!
//! These machines **sleep as their normal resting state** — the HTPC and the
//! gaming PC are both suspended most of the day. A single shared `availability`
//! at the document root made every entity `unavailable` for all of that time,
//! which is a bad trade: the state topic is *retained*, so the broker is still
//! holding a perfectly good last-known reading that availability then hides.
//!
//! So availability is stamped per-component by [`base_discovery`], in tiers:
//!
//! | tier | entities | gated? | rendering while asleep |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | commands | every `button` | **yes** | `unavailable` — pressing it cannot work |
//! | liveness | `status_stale`, `age_seconds` | **yes** | `unavailable` — a frozen value would lie |
//! | facts | everything else | no | last known value, as of `published_at` |
//!
//! Two things make the ungated tier safe rather than merely quieter. First,
//! `published_at` carries `device_class: timestamp`, which Home Assistant renders
//! as relative time — so "how old is this?" is answered on the face of the
//! dashboard rather than inferred from an entity being missing. Second, the
//! `connected` binary sensor reads the LWT topic directly, so the online/offline
//! fact the root availability used to encode is still a first-class entity.
//!
//! Getting the tiers wrong is silent in both directions: an ungated liveness
//! sensor reports stale data as fresh, and a gated connectivity sensor goes
//! `unavailable` exactly when it has something to report.
