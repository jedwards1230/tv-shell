//! Shared wire types for the tv-shell Steam-library feature.
//!
//! These types are the single source of truth for the JSON shape exchanged
//! between `tv-shell-host` (the cross-platform sidecar that enumerates and
//! launches Steam games on the gaming PC) and `tv-shell-input` (the daemon on
//! the TV client that proxies `GET /library` / `POST /launch` / `GET /status` /
//! `POST /quit` / `POST /sleep` for the QML shell). The daemon reaches the host over **HTTP on the LAN** — the
//! host runs on a separate machine (the gaming PC; see `docs/HOST_SETUP.md`), so
//! the daemon is an HTTP *client*, not a process supervisor: it does not spawn,
//! health-restart, or otherwise manage the host's lifecycle. Both sides
//! (de)serialize through these types so the wire shape can't drift — the host
//! serializes them in its axum handlers (`host/src/main.rs`), and the daemon
//! deserializes the responses in `daemon/src/steam.rs`.
//!
//! Pure serde, no I/O — so both crates depend on it without dragging in either
//! one's heavier graph (axum on the host, evdev/cec on the daemon).
//!
//! The [`brand`] module carries the product identity (slug, env prefix, metric
//! prefix, config-dir resolution) shared by the daemon and host, with the
//! game-shell → tv-shell backward-compat shims in one place.
