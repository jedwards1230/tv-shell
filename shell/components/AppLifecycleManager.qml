    // === Kiosk fullscreen assertion for a resume (#347) ===

    // TOGGLE vs SET — the distinction this whole component got wrong once before.
    // #308 removed a client-side `hyprctl dispatch fullscreen 0` from the resume
    // path, and that removal was CORRECT: the bare form is a TOGGLE. Fired at an
    // already-fullscreen window it flips it back OUT of fullscreen, which — with
    // a second app backgrounded — let the tiler split the screen. Because it
    // raced Hyprland's own on_focus_under_fullscreen swap, whether it helped or
    // broke things depended on who won, i.e. it was non-deterministic
    // (docs/KIOSK_WINDOW_MODEL.md, incident 1).
    //
    // `fullscreen 0 set` is the IDEMPOTENT form: it SETS fullscreen state rather
    // than inverting it, so issuing it against a window that is already
    // fullscreen is a no-op instead of a regression. That is precisely why the
    // daemon's own enforcement (`force_fullscreen` / `enforce_active_fullscreen`
    // in daemon/src/hyprland.rs) uses this exact form on every openwindow,
    // closewindow, movewindowv2 and activewindowv2 — this matches that idiom
    // rather than reintroducing a competing one. Two idempotent writers of the
    // same state cannot race into a wrong result the way a toggle and a setter
    // could.
    //
    // WHY QML NEEDS IT AT ALL, given the daemon backstop: prewarmed apps map
    // TILED (the `[silent]` exec rule, #238) while foreground apps map fullscreen.
    // Focusing a tiled window that sits UNDER a fullscreen one changes focus but
    // not what is on screen, so the resume appears to do nothing. The declarative
    // on_focus_under_fullscreen swap plus the daemon's activewindowv2 backstop
    // are supposed to promote it; when they miss, the resumed window is
    // focused-but-invisible and nothing else ever corrects it. This is the
    // resume-path guarantee that closes that gap — and being idempotent, it costs
    // nothing when they did fire.
    //
    // ORDERING REQUIREMENT — THIS DISPATCH MUST NOT BE MOVED EARLIER.
    // `fullscreen 0 set` takes NO window selector: it acts on whatever is ACTIVE
    // when it runs (measured on-device — with nothing active it prints "Window
    // not found" and still exits 0, so it cannot even report having hit the wrong
    // thing). Hyprland applies focus asynchronously, so at the moment the focus
    // Process returns, the active window may still be the PREVIOUS one — firing
    // this there would fullscreen that previous window. In the #347 scenario
    // (resume a tiled Plex while a fullscreen Steam is active) that re-asserts
    // fullscreen on STEAM, i.e. reproduces the bug. Idempotence does not save it:
    // `set` is idempotent in which STATE it applies, not which WINDOW.
    //
    // It is therefore fired ONLY from the verified `hypr-active` read below,
    // where the compositor has confirmed our intended window is the active one —
    // which makes "act on the active window" provably correct rather than a race.

    // delay is the correctness mechanism, not latency to be tuned away.
