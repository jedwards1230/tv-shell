# shell-v2 — the tv-shell v2 shell

A spike. It is built beside v1's `shell/`, wired into no session, and it exists to
prove three things under gamescope: **it maps, it self-tags its X11 atoms before
it maps, and it takes controller focus.**

Every pixel is placeholder. The structure is not — this tree sets the patterns
every later screen follows, so the parts worth reviewing are the shapes.

Why it has to exist at all is measured, not assumed: gamescope resolves a window's
app id at **creation** and never re-reads it, so a property arriving after the map
has missed the decision (bench 2026-09-06 on the pinned 3.16.28, plus a live
control on 2026-09-07 — `../docs/V2_SHELL.md` §8a).

Full rationale, the two repo rules it reverses, the mutation record, and (at
equal length) what it does **not** prove: [`../docs/V2_SHELL.md`](../docs/V2_SHELL.md).
The compositor contract it implements: [`../docs/V2_DESIGN.md`](../docs/V2_DESIGN.md) §5, §7, §13 Q1.

## Layout

```
CMakeLists.txt          The build step v1 deliberately lacks. ONE QML module, URI TvShell.
src/
  surfacetags.{h,cpp}   PURE role -> STEAM_* atoms. No Qt GUI, no X in its link line.
  x11tagger.{h,cpp}     The ONLY place the shell speaks X (mirrors core/src/atoms.rs).
  surface.{h,cpp}       Surface: a toplevel that declares its ROLE and tags before map.
  main.cpp              Entry point; warns loudly on a non-xcb platform plugin.
qml/TvShell/            The single QML module — no qmldir, no relative-dir imports.
  Main.qml              Placeholder screen: three SEPARATE toplevels + a D-pad grid.
  FocusRouter.qml       Owns currentId; every decision delegates to focusGraph.js.
  FocusSlot.qml         One cell: declares WHERE it sits, never who its neighbours are.
  focusGraph.js         Pure .pragma library: neighbour / rehome / initial / problems.
tests/                  Three lanes — see below.
```

## Three things to know before editing

1. **`Surface` tags before map, and Qt gives no virtual hook to do it.**
   `QWindow::setVisible` is not virtual in Qt 6 and neither is `create()`. The
   ordering is enforced by redeclaring the `visible` property, hiding the base
   `setVisible`, **deleting** `show()`/`showNormal()`/`showFullScreen()`/
   `showMaximized()`, and deferring visibility to `componentComplete()`. If you
   find yourself adding a way to show a window, you are about to map an untagged
   one. Read `src/surface.h` first.

2. **Nothing sets an atom directly.** A caller sets `role`; the role decides the
   atoms. That is what makes an overlay drawn inside the base window
   unrepresentable rather than merely discouraged.

3. **Focus is computed, never wired.** A `FocusSlot` declares `row`, `column` and
   `slotEnabled`. It does not name a neighbour, and neither does anything else.
   Disabling a slot cannot strand focus: traversal skips empty rows and the router
   re-homes off a cell that stops being focusable. Put new decision logic in
   `focusGraph.js` (pure, headlessly tested), not in a binding.

## Build and test

```bash
cmake -S shell-v2 -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
cmake --build build --target all_qmllint
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

| Lane | Needs | Asserts |
|---|---|---|
| `surfacetags` | nothing | the role → atoms mapping, including the two negative rules |
| `qml` | nothing (offscreen) | `focusGraph.js` directly, plus a real router over real slots |
| `premap` | a real X server | `PropertyNotify` before `MapNotify`, per role |

`premap` is opt-in behind `TV_SHELL_TEST_XVFB`, read at **configure** time:

```bash
Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1280x800x24 &
TV_SHELL_TEST_XVFB=:99 cmake -S shell-v2 -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Without it `ctest` reports two lanes; with it, three. CI sets it.

## Running it

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb ./build/tv-shell-v2
```

Arrows move focus, **space** toggles the middle cell (watch focus re-home rather
than strand), **menu** opens the overlay toplevel, **tab** shows the toast. The
header line reports the current cell id and whether the base window was tagged.

On a Wayland platform plugin it starts, warns, and maps untagged — under gamescope
that means it is never a focus candidate, which looks like a black screen. The
warning is the diagnosis.
