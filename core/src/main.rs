//! `tv-shell-core` entry point.
//!
//! Startup order matters and is the §9 "core is stateless" contract:
//!
//! 1. Load and **validate** config before anything uses a value from it.
//! 2. Connect to X and intern the atoms — a name typo fails here, not at the
//!    first switch.
//! 3. **Reconcile**: read the base-layer list back as the last intent. The core
//!    never writes "home" on boot; that would yank a live game.
//! 4. Serve IPC until a signal says to stop.
//! 5. **Then**, and only for a compositor that reconcile showed is FRESH, run
//!    the boot client (see [`boot`]). It is step 5 rather than step 3½ because
//!    the socket must exist before anything slow does — an operator debugging a
//!    session that will not come up needs the control surface more than the
//!    session needs its first app.
//!
//! There is also one non-serving mode, `write-session-env <path>`, which the
//! session script runs before starting the target. It is here rather than in a
//! shell helper because it is the one place `[display]` in `core.toml` becomes
//! the mode gamescope is actually started at — see [`CoreConfig::session_env`].
