//! Typed X11 atom layer for gamescope's published state.
//!
//! Under gamescope's SteamControlled focus policy the whole kiosk contract is a
//! set of root-window properties plus a few per-window ones (V2_DESIGN §5 table).
//! This module is the ONLY place in the core that speaks X: everything above it
//! sees typed values, never `u32` blobs and never atom names.
//!
//! Three rules are baked into the API rather than left to callers:
//!
//! 1. **A missing atom is a normal absent value, never an error.** gamescope
//!    creates most of these lazily — `GAMESCOPE_VRR_FEEDBACK` simply does not
//!    exist before the first VRR evaluation, and an unset
//!    `GAMESCOPECTRL_BASELAYER_APPID` is the ordinary boot state. Every read
//!    returns `Ok(None)` / `Ok(vec![])` for absent, and reserves `Err` for a
//!    connection or protocol failure. This is the direct lesson of v1's
//!    "silent success" class inverted: absence must be *representable*, so it is
//!    never confused with failure and never papered over.
//! 2. **Every property is a 32-bit id array.** gamescope writes these as 32-bit
//!    arrays (`steamcompmgr.cpp`), including the booleans, which are `0`/`1`.
//!    The **width is the invariant**; the accepted types are `CARDINAL` and
//!    `WINDOW` (see [`decode_cardinals`] for why both). A read that finds any
//!    other width or type is a typed error, not a coerced value — a shape we did
//!    not expect is exactly the #448 failure (unit fixtures asserting the shape
//!    the code wanted rather than the bytes the compositor sends). A reply that
//!    is only *part* of the property is the same class of failure and is
//!    likewise an error ([`AtomError::Truncated`]).
//! 3. **Atoms are interned once**, at connect, so a read is one round trip and
//!    a name typo fails at startup rather than at the first switch.

/// such property"), which maps to an empty vector, never an error. A non-zero

/// # Why `WINDOW` is accepted alongside `CARDINAL`
///
/// The **width is the invariant here; the type is not measured per-atom yet.**
/// Everything this crate has actually observed is 32-bit, and every value in
/// these properties is a 32-bit id either way — `XA_WINDOW` and `XA_CARDINAL`
/// differ in what the id *means*, not in how it is encoded. But
/// `GAMESCOPE_FOCUSED_WINDOW` and `GAMESCOPECTRL_BASELAYER_WINDOW` hold window
/// ids, and `WINDOW` is an entirely plausible type for a compositor to publish
/// them as. Rejecting it would make every [`crate::screen::read`] hard-fail on a
/// perfectly healthy compositor — a strictness that turns into an outage
/// instead of a diagnosis.
///
/// So this accepts both 32-bit id types and still rejects every other type and
/// every width but 32. What settles it properly is the §10 headless-gamescope
/// job: that is where the real per-atom types get measured, and this list gets
/// narrowed (or widened) against bytes rather than against reasoning.
