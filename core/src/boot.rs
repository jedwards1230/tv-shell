//! The boot client — starting the session's first app, and the rule that stops
//! it stealing a live one.
//!
//! # The problem this module is careful about
//!
//! §5 and §9 say the core **never writes the base layer at startup**: a core
//! restart under a running game would yank the screen away from it. §9 also
//! wants `Restart=always` on the core unit, so a restart under a live session is
//! not a rare event — it is the designed recovery path, and it is the case where
//! getting this wrong is most expensive (the user is *playing something*).
//!
//! But a freshly booted session has to start *something*, or the television
//! comes up black. Those two requirements look contradictory and are not,
//! because they are about different worlds:
//!
//! | | base layer | on screen | what it is |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | fresh session | empty (atom absent) | nothing | nobody has used this compositor yet |
//! | core restart under a game | populated | the game | someone is using it right now |
//! | user quit back to the shell | populated (shell id) | shell | someone used it and stopped |
//! | X read failed | unknown | unknown | we do not know, so we must not act |
//!
//! **A boot launch is not "the core started"; it is "this compositor has never
//! been used".** That is an observation, and [`decide`] makes it from the same
//! reconcile the core already performs — no flag, no marker file, no "first
//! run" state on disk. The core stays stateless (§9), which is what makes this
//! safe under a restart the operator did not plan.
//!
//! Two consequences worth stating because they are deliberate, not oversights:
//!
//! * **A core restart never relaunches the boot app.** Even if the user quit the
//!   app and is sitting on the shell, the base layer holds the shell id, so the
//!   session reads as in-use and the core leaves it alone. Resurrecting an app
//!   somebody closed is worse than doing nothing.
//! * **An unreadable X state does not launch.** A failed read is not evidence of
//!   an empty session; it is no evidence at all. Fail closed — the [`decide`]
//!   caller passes `None` and gets [`BootDecision::SessionUnreadable`].
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! `main` runs this AFTER the IPC socket is listening. A cold app start can take
//! seconds (the map bound is 30 s by default), and §9 makes the control surface
//! the thing an operator reaches for when the session is wedged — so the socket
//! must not be waiting on an app. Everything the boot sequence does goes through
//! the same [`Compositor`] the IPC layer uses, so its `show` takes the same
//! `IntentGate` as an operator's: a boot in flight and a concurrent `show`
//! serialize instead of racing.
