//! `tv-shell-core` — the v2 successor to `daemon/` (`tv-shell-input`).
//!
//! Built **beside** v1, not instead of it (V2_DESIGN §11): `daemon/`, `host/`,
//! `protocol/` and `panel/` are untouched and still build, v1 keeps booting on
//! the couch, and the two share no config file, socket or unit name.
//!
//! What this crate owns today:
//!
//! | Module | Owns |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`atoms`] | The typed X root-atom layer — gamescope's published state (§5) |
//! | [`boot`] | The boot client: whether a fresh session gets its first app, and the observation that stops a restart stealing a live one |
//! | [`screen`] | [`screen::ScreenState`], the one snapshot that replaces v1's `hypr-active`/`hypr-clients`/`hypr-monitors` |
//! | [`launch`] | Scoped launching: `systemd-run --user --scope`, and reading a scope back out of a cgroup path |
//! | [`baselayer`] | `show`/`home` as one write plus one bounded verify |
//! | [`screenshot`] | `screenshot <path>`: the capture path that replaces v1's `grim`, which gamescope cannot serve |
//! | [`config`] | `~/.config/tv-shell/core.toml` — a separate file from v1's |
//! | [`protocol`] | The IPC grammar, carried over from v1 unchanged in contract (§4) |
//! | [`ipc`] | The Unix-socket server |
//! | [`compositor`] | The seam between the two: verbs → X primitives |
//! | [`input`] | The pad fleet: discovery, `EVIOCGRAB`, permanent per-player presenters (§7). **Default-off** |
//!
//! Explicitly **not** here yet, each a follow-up: CEC, the QML shell, panel
//! changes, HTTP/MCP/MQTT/metrics, the forced-paint heartbeat, per-app Xwayland
//! server creation — and, within [`input`], routing to a shell, the Meta-hold
//! and safety-combo escapes, rumble/battery/LED, and companion-node inhibition.
//!
//! It is a lib plus a thin bin for the same reason the daemon is: `pub` items in
//! a library are public API and are never "dead", so `clippy -D warnings` stays
//! clean even where a module is not yet wired into `main`.

/// The ONE lock every test that mutates the process environment must hold.
///
/// `std::env::set_var` is `unsafe` because it is unsound under **any**
/// concurrent environment access, not merely a racing write to the same
/// variable — the environ block itself can be reallocated under a reader. So a
/// per-module guard is not enough, and this crate had two: one in `config`'s
/// tests and one in `launch`'s. They did not exclude each other, and the result
/// was a config test failing in a run whose only change was in `boot` — a flake
/// with no plausible local cause, which is the worst kind to chase.
///
/// One lock, crate-wide. A test that mutates the environment takes THIS.
