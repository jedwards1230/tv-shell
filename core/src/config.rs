//! v2 core configuration — `~/.config/tv-shell/core.toml`.
//!
//! # Why this is a separate file from v1's `config.toml`
//!
//! V2_DESIGN §11: "beside, not instead, at every shared layer". The v1 daemon's
//! `DaemonConfig` root carries `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`, so adding a `[display]`
//! or `[session]` table to `config.toml` would make the **v1 daemon abort at
//! startup** — and the symptom would present as "v1 is broken", not "someone
//! added a v2 table". v1 must keep booting on the couch while v2 is developed
//! beside it, so v2 gets its own file. Nothing here is ever read by v1, and
//! nothing v1 reads is ever written here.
//!
//! The path is overridable with `TV_SHELL_CORE_CONFIG` for tests and for running
//! two cores on one box.
//!
//! # Conventions carried from `daemon/src/daemon_config.rs`
//!
//! * Root and every section are `#[serde(default, deny_unknown_fields)]`, so a
//!   typo fails loudly at startup rather than silently running a default.
//! * Three tiers: [`CoreConfig::load`] (path from env) → [`CoreConfig::load_from`]
//!   (I/O, testable) → [`CoreConfig::parse`] (pure).
//! * A missing file is not an error (all-defaults); a present-but-malformed one
//!   is, because an operator should learn their config was ignored.
//! * [`CoreConfig::validate`] is separate and runs before anything uses the
//!   values, with `anyhow::bail!("config: ...")` messages naming the bad value.
