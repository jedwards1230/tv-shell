//! The pad fleet: which physical pads the core holds, which slot each occupies,
//! and what a fresh enumeration means for that set.
//!
//! # Polled, not event-driven
//!
//! Membership is recomputed from a full enumeration on every poll, and a pad is
//! considered gone because it is **absent from the enumeration**, not because
//! some listener fired. V2_DESIGN §10 makes that the house rule after v1's
//! residual defect: an event listener that was attached and processed nothing,
//! visible only as a widening gap between events seen and windows seen. A poll
//! that stops has no such quiet failure mode — it either produces a list or it
//! does not.
//!
//! The runtime *also* retires a pad whose event stream errors, because a USB
//! unplug surfaces there first and there is no reason to wait a poll interval to
//! quiesce a presenter. Both paths funnel through [`Fleet::retire`], so the
//! bookkeeping has one implementation regardless of which noticed.
//!
//! # Nothing here creates or destroys a presenter
//!
//! [`Plan`] has no variant that could. That is not an oversight to be filled in
//! later: V2_DESIGN §7 requires presenters to be permanent, so making a
//! presenter lifecycle change *unrepresentable* in the type the join/leave path
//! produces is the strongest available statement of it.
