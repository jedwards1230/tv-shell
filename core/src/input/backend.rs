//! The hardware seam.
//!
//! Everything that touches `/dev/input`, `/dev/uinput` or an `ioctl` is behind
//! this trait, so [`super::session::InputSession`] — which holds every rule
//! about which pad is claimed, which slot it takes and what crosses onto a
//! presenter — is exercised in CI on a host with no seat, no `/dev/uinput` and
//! no pad.
//!
//! The backend owns the open devices, including their event streams. A claimed
//! pad's stream is never handed out, because the file descriptor **is** the
//! grab: `EVIOCGRAB` lives on the open file description, so whoever holds the fd
//! holds the exclusive claim, and splitting those two apart would make "release"
//! a request rather than a fact.
//!
//! # What a test double here can and cannot prove
//!
//! A double can prove **our call sequence**: that presenters and the shell
//! keyboard are created once at start and never again, that a leave quiesces
//! before it releases, that a pad we cannot seat is given back, that a routed
//! event reaches the keyboard and NOT the presenter. That is our code, and it is
//! what the doubles in `session.rs` assert.
//!
//! A double **cannot** prove that `EVIOCGRAB` excludes other readers, that
//! uinput publishes the devnode we then claim ownership of, that the kernel
//! really took the keyboard's `1..=31` block, or that a game reads the presenter
//! at all. Nothing in this crate asserts those, because a fake
//! that "grabbed" would only be testing the fake. They are hardware claims,
//! verified on hardware.
