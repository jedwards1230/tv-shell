//! Atom round-trips against a real X server.
//!
//! These exercise the half of `atoms.rs` / `screen.rs` that unit tests cannot:
//! that the properties this crate writes are the ones an X server actually
//! stores, and that [`screen::read`] reassembles them into the state the code
//! above it believes. Everything else about those modules is pure and covered by
//! the in-crate unit tests.
//!
//! # The gate
//!
//! Every test here is `#[ignore]`d and keyed on `TV_SHELL_TEST_XVFB`, the same
//! shape `host/tests/mqtt_broker.rs` uses for `TV_SHELL_TEST_BROKER`:
//!
//! ```text
//! Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1920x1080x24 &
//! TV_SHELL_TEST_XVFB=:99 cargo test -p tv-shell-core --test atoms_xvfb -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! **Run with `--ignored` but no `TV_SHELL_TEST_XVFB` and these PANIC** rather
//! than quietly passing. A skipped check is indistinguishable from a passing one,
//! and deliberate opt-in is the only way these ever execute — so `cargo test`
//! stays offline and hermetic by default.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no `cfg(target_os)` gate**: `#[ignore]` already keeps
//! these out of the default run, and the file must stay compiled and
//! clippy-clean wherever the crate builds.
//!
//! # What an Xvfb server can and cannot show
//!
//! Xvfb is not gamescope: it publishes none of these atoms itself. So these
//! tests write the values and read them back, which is exactly the contract this
//! crate owns — the encode/decode and the assembly. What they cannot check is
//! whether gamescope *writes* the shapes assumed here; that is the headless
//! gamescope job in V2_DESIGN §10, and until it exists the live bench is the
//! authority. The fixtures below are therefore real measured values from
//! `dev/gamescope/lib.sh`, not invented ones (the #448 lesson).
