# Observability

The `tv-shell-input` daemon emits observability in Linux-native, standard,
self-describing formats so **any** consumer can collect it their way. This repo
emits the signal; **collection and forwarding are intentionally out of scope**
(they are deployment-private — point your own node_exporter / Prometheus /
journald pipeline at the contract below).

There are two signals:

1. **Logs** → the systemd **journal** (structured, syslog-priority-mapped), with
   a plain-stdout fallback.
2. **Metrics** → a Prometheus/OpenMetrics **textfile** for the node_exporter
   textfile collector (primary), plus a portable HTTP **`/metrics`** scrape
   endpoint (alternative).

---

## Logs

`init_tracing()` chooses a logging backend at startup:

- **systemd journal** (via `tracing-journald`) when a journal is available —
  structured fields + syslog priority mapping (so `journalctl -p` works).
- **stdout** (the original compact `fmt` layer) otherwise, and always on
  non-Linux.

Selection is automatic but overridable via `[observability]` in
`~/.config/tv-shell/config.toml`:

| Config key (`[observability]`) | Values | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `log_journal` | `true` | Force the journald layer on. |
| | `false` | Force stdout (no journald). |
| | _omitted_ (default) | **Auto**: use journald when `JOURNAL_STREAM` is set (i.e. launched under a systemd unit) and the journal socket is reachable; otherwise stdout. |

The log level/targets remain an env var (NOT a config key), so the standard
`RUST_LOG=… tv-shell-input` workflow is unchanged:

| Env var | Values | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `RUST_LOG` | e.g. `info`, `tv_shell_input=debug` | Standard `EnvFilter` syntax. Honoured identically on **both** paths. Default `info`. |

If the journald layer is requested but the journal socket cannot be opened, the
daemon logs a one-line notice to stderr and falls back to stdout — it is never
left without logging.

### Reading logs

When run under the user service (the common deployment):

```bash
journalctl --user -u tv-shell-input            # all logs
journalctl --user -u tv-shell-input -f         # follow
journalctl --user -u tv-shell-input -p warning # warnings and above
journalctl --user -u tv-shell-input -o json    # structured fields
```

Raise verbosity by setting the `RUST_LOG` env var (it stays an env var, not a
config key), e.g. `RUST_LOG=tv_shell_input=debug tv-shell-input`. The
`publish` chokepoint at `debug` is a full event tracer (intents, combos,
`pad:*`, input-mode, controller-wake).

**CEC display-ownership history** rides these logs. Every observed change of who
owns the display is logged at `info` with `previous`/`current`/`source` fields —
the cache published on `GET /status` keeps only the *current* owner and its
change time, so the journal is the replayable history:

```bash
journalctl --user -u tv-shell-input --grep 'display ownership'
```

A run with no such lines and `cec_display_owner_tracking: true` on
`GET /status` means the bus genuinely never broadcast `<Active Source>` — the
one reading that distinguishes "correctly reports unknown" from "the receive
callback never fires". See
[CONTROL_SURFACE.md](CONTROL_SURFACE.md#cec-display-ownership-cec_).

## The Quickshell log (`/tmp/qs-log.txt`)

The QML shell is a separate process from the daemon, and its log is a separate
signal. `tv-shell-quickshell.service` tees Quickshell's merged stdout/stderr to
**both** journald (tagged `tv-shell-quickshell`) and `/tmp/qs-log.txt`, which
`/dev/logs` tails and `/dev/restart-shell` reads its warning tail from. The file
is truncated on every shell start.

```bash
journalctl --user -t tv-shell-quickshell -f    # follow
tail -f /tmp/qs-log.txt                        # same stream, restart-truncated
```

The daemon also **counts** that file. A background scanner samples it every 15s
and folds new WARN/ERROR lines into `tv_shell_quickshell_warnings_total`, so the
invariant below is a Prometheus series rather than something you only notice by
reading logs.

### Signal-to-noise is a maintained invariant, not an accident

**A healthy shell start emits a handful of WARN lines, not hundreds.** If you
see a warning class repeating in the thousands, that is a bug in this repo —
treat it as one. Do not filter it at the reader.

That rule is load-bearing because we already broke it once. A measured baseline
before the fix: **1,108 WARN lines in the first 69 seconds** of a shell start
(and 10,498 over a 23-hour session). Zero ERROR lines. Every class was benign in
isolation, which is exactly why it went unnoticed — and it made `/dev/logs` and
the `/dev/restart-shell` tail useless for real debugging.

**The invariant is now enforced, not just documented.**
`tv_shell_quickshell_warnings_total` counts exactly those lines, using the same
`WARN`/`ERROR` predicate as the `/dev/restart-shell` tail
(`bridge_core::is_warning_line` — one source of truth, so the number and the tail
can never disagree). "Benign classes nobody reads" is precisely the failure mode
a counter catches, so alert on the *rate*:

```promql
# Sustained warning flood: >1 WARN/ERROR per second averaged over 15 minutes.
# The pre-fix baseline was ~16/s; a healthy start is a handful, then ~0.
rate(tv_shell_quickshell_warnings_total{job="node-1-tv-shell"}[15m]) > 1
```

```promql
# Noisy start: more than 100 warnings in the 10 minutes after a shell restart.
increase(tv_shell_quickshell_warnings_total{job="node-1-tv-shell"}[10m]) > 100
```

### Counting a truncated log monotonically

`/tmp/qs-log.txt` is truncated on **every** shell start — by the unit's `tee`
(`config/tv-shell-quickshell.service`) and by the daemon's fallback spawn. A
naive "count the lines and store the number" would therefore be a gauge that
resets to zero on each restart, and `rate()` over it would be nonsense. The
scanner (`metrics::run_quickshell_warning_scanner`) keeps `(len, inode, count)`
between ticks and:

- treats a **shrink in length or a change of inode** as a new file, adding the
  whole current count as the delta — `tee` truncates the *same* inode, so the
  length check is the one that normally fires and the inode check covers an
  unlink-and-replace;
- otherwise adds `new_count - last_count`;
- **seeds from the current file on the daemon's first tick without adding a
  delta.** The daemon restarts independently of the shell
  (`/dev/restart-daemon` re-execs it), and without seeding a daemon restart
  would replay a whole session's warnings into one scrape interval. The counter
  resetting to `0` on a daemon restart is normal and expected — `rate()` handles
  it, and `tv_shell_shell_restarts_total` marks it.
- **treats a MISSING log as an observation of an empty one**, seeding at zero
  rather than skipping the tick. This is what makes a cold boot work, and it is
  subtle enough to be worth spelling out: on a fresh boot `/tmp/qs-log.txt` does
  not exist yet when the daemon's first tick fires, and the shell's entire
  startup burst lands seconds later. If "absent" were a skip, the state would
  still be unseeded when that burst arrived, the seed would adopt it as history,
  and the counter would read `0` through precisely the flood it exists to catch —
  the measured 1,108-line regression was a *cold-boot* flood. Seeding at zero
  instead makes the burst an ordinary append. A genuine read **error** is still a
  skip: unlike `NotFound` it tells us nothing about the contents.

One case is deliberately **not** recovered: warnings written and then truncated
away *inside* a single 15s scan interval are lost. The alternative would be
hooking the restart path, which cannot work — the unit's `Restart=on-failure`
restarts Quickshell without the daemon ever hearing about it.

The scan runs in its own task, spawned unconditionally, and **never inside
`render()`**: `render` runs on every `/metrics` scrape *and* every textfile tick,
so reading the file there would tie counting to scrape frequency and double-count
whenever both sinks are enabled.

The four root causes, all fixed, are worth knowing because each is a trap that
is easy to reintroduce:

**1. Degenerate screen geometry collapsed every derived size (~795 lines).**
`Units.qml` derives `gridUnit` — and therefore every spacing, radius and icon
size in the shell — from `Quickshell.screens[0].height`. That list goes
transiently **empty** during startup, DPMS, mode-set and CEC/TV power events,
and a `ShellScreen` can briefly report a height of ~0. The old code fell back to
a literal `2160` on an empty list and did no flooring.

The screen does not appear at its final size — it **resolves in stages**, and
the old binding turned every stage into a full rescale. Measured on the 4K
panel, one start walked `0` → an intermediate report → the settled `2160`,
producing three separate icon waves at `QSize(2, 2)` (the provider clamps a
0-size request to 1px × DPR 2), `QSize(120, 120)` and `QSize(240, 240)`. Only
the last is the real size. `AppIcon` sets `cache: false` (load-bearing for a
separate stale-texture bug), so every wave is a fresh provider hit, and the
degenerate size fed to `QSvgIconEngine` produced the
`qt.svg.draw: The requested buffer size is too big` lines.

Note `Quickshell.screens[0].height` reports the **physical** height (2160 here),
not the scale-2 logical 1080 — so `240` is the correct settled `iconSizeXL` and
`120` was itself a mid-settle artifact. Do not assume the seeded placeholder
matches the real height; on this panel it happens to, which is a coincidence,
and `screenReady` is what makes that safe on any other display.

> **Invariant:** `Units` holds the last *valid* screen height and exposes a
> `screenReady` flag. Nothing derived from screen geometry may be requested
> before a real height has been adopted. If you add a size that feeds an
> `Image`'s `sourceSize`, it must not be computable from an empty screen list.

**2. Icons were resolved against the wrong theme (~960 lines).**
Qt selects a platform theme from `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME`; on this host it was
unset and `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` is `Hyprland`, so `QIcon` fell back to bare
`hicolor` — which contains **none** of the standard freedesktop names that
`.desktop` entries use. The icons were never missing from the system: `breeze`,
`breeze-dark` and the `Adwaita` chain are all installed and carry nearly all of
them.

`tv-shell-quickshell.service` now sets `Environment=QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=kde`
(plasma-integration's platform theme, already installed), which resolves to
`breeze-dark` with a `breeze` fallback and adds the XDG icon search paths. It
does **not** require `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=KDE` — leave that as `Hyprland`, since
changing it also steers xdg-desktop-portal backend selection.

Note the amplification: only **12 distinct icon names** produced all ~960 lines.
`AppIcon.qml` sets `cache: false` (load-bearing for the stale-neighbour-texture
bug on delegate recycling — do not change it), so every re-source re-resolves
and re-warns. `AppIcon` now keeps a session-scoped negative memo
(`lib/iconMemo.js`): a name that has failed once at a valid size is never
requested again, and the existing letter-initial fallback renders instead.

> **Known gap:** `image://icon/` can return a *Ready* magenta placeholder rather
> than an `Image.Error` for some missing names, so the memo only catches names
> that genuinely error. `Quickshell.iconPath(name, true)` is *not* a fix — that
> overload does not return `""` for theme-missing names on this Quickshell
> build (tried and reverted).

**3. A poll reset the whole Steam model every 10 s (24 lines, plus real churn).**
`SteamLibraryView` reassigned `recentItems`/`allItems` on every successful
`ServiceMonitor` reply. Those are fresh lists each time, so the property
identity changed even when the payload was byte-identical, the `ListView` model
reset, and **every delegate was destroyed and rebuilt** — re-walking each
`SteamCard` art candidate chain from index 0 and re-emitting its 404s. The
assignments are now gated on a content signature, the same way
`AppLifecycleManager` gates `runningWindows`.

> **Invariant:** if you assign a list property from a poll reply, gate it on a
> content signature covering exactly the fields the delegate binds. A field the
> delegate binds but the signature omits means a real update is silently
> dropped — a far worse bug than the noise.

**4. A binding loop in `AppsWidget` (8 lines).** `_activeModel` had two cycles:
a writable `_segment` imperatively coerced from `onModelChanged`, and a
cross-component path where `HomeScreen`'s hint bar read back *upstream* to
`_recentModel`. Both are broken by deriving rather than writing. Qt abandons a
re-entered binding update, so the visible symptom was a **stale** `_activeModel`
— the warning was the only evidence.

> **Invariant:** never write a dependency of a derived property from a handler
> on another of its dependencies, and never let a downstream consumer read back
> upstream. `tests/qml/tst_appssegment.qml` pins this with
> `failOnWarning: /Binding loop/`.

### Why there is no reader-side filter

`/dev/restart-shell`'s warning tail used to drop every `COULD NOT LOAD ICON`
line unconditionally, because ~960 of them buried everything else. That filter
is **gone on purpose**: now that the source is fixed, filtering there would only
hide a regression. The panel's *opt-in* "Hide icon noise" toggle
(`panel/src/pages/logs.rs`) is a different thing — a user-chosen view, not a
forced one — and can be retired once the fix has held for a while.

If you find yourself wanting to add a filter to read the log, fix the emitter
instead.

### The residual 36: three names, three different root causes

After the four fixes above, a cold shell start on the reference device still
emitted **36** `Could not load icon "X" at size QSize(w,h) from request` lines,
across exactly three names — 12 each. The repeat counts are a product of
screen-scale restages (`gridUnit` walks 1080→2160, so `iconSizeXL` walks
120→240), `Variants { model: Quickshell.screens }` rebuilding the shell tree when
the screens list churns, and `LibraryScreen` eagerly instantiating a `Repeater`
over every installed app while hidden. Three names, and **no two share a cause**:

| Name | Origin | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `web-browser` | **Ours.** `webapps.rs` hardcoded `Icon=web-browser` into every generated web-app `.desktop`. Breeze — which the shell selects via `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=kde` — ships `internet-web-browser`; plain `web-browser` exists only under `AdwaitaLegacy`, outside Breeze's inheritance chain. | Template now emits `internet-web-browser`, plus a one-shot startup migration that rewrites the `Icon=` line of entries already on disk (guarded by the `X-TvShell-WebApp` ownership marker, so a foreign `.desktop` is never touched). |
| `hwloc` | **A third-party entry with a dangling reference.** `/usr/share/applications/lstopo.desktop` sets `Icon=hwloc`, and no `hwloc` (or `lstopo`) icon file exists anywhere under `/usr/share/icons` or `/usr/share/pixmaps`. There is nothing to alias it to. | The daemon now blanks, at scan time, any `Icon=` that resolves to no file at all, so the app falls back to `AppCard`'s letter tile and never issues a doomed request. See below. |
| `hyprland-donate-screen` | **A live Hyprland nag window** whose window class was used verbatim as an icon name. | Handled on the QML side. |

A blocklist of the three names would have papered over three unrelated bugs.

### Why `iconMemo` cannot close this class

`iconMemo.js` (added by #441) is a negative memo: a name that fails once is never
requested again. It is **completely inert for all three names above**, and this is
structural, not a tuning problem.

Quickshell's `image://icon` provider returns a magenta **placeholder** pixmap for
a theme-missing name and reports `Image.Ready`. `AppIcon.qml` only records into
the memo on `Image.Error`, which therefore never fires. The gap is already
flagged in `AppIcon.qml`'s own comments.

Nor is it fixable one layer up. `Quickshell.iconPath(name, true)` — the obvious
"ask whether it resolves before requesting it" — does **not** return `""` for
theme-missing names on the Quickshell build running on the reference device.
Commit `aee043c` tried exactly that and was reverted by `e371e8e`. Anyone
proposing "just memoise it" should read those two commits first.

So the fix has to happen **at the source of the icon name**, which is why the
table above has three different fixes rather than one.

### The daemon-side resolvable check

The durable guard against the `hwloc` class — a third-party `.desktop` shipping a
reference to an icon that does not exist — lives in `apps.rs`. At scan time, an
`Icon=` name that appears in **no** icon file anywhere is replaced with an empty
string, so the shell renders its designed letter-tile fallback and never issues a
request that can only warn.

It works off a flat index of icon **basenames** under the standard roots
(`/usr/share/icons`, `/usr/share/pixmaps`, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/icons`, `~/.icons`,
`~/.local/share/icons`, plus the Flatpak export equivalents), built lazily **once
per process** — `/usr/share/icons` on a KDE box is tens of thousands of files and
`scan_apps` runs on every `list-apps` call. Installing a new icon theme
mid-session needs a daemon restart before its icons count as resolvable.

An absolute (or otherwise slash-bearing) `Icon=` is passed through untouched and
never stat'ed. A blanked name is logged at `debug`, never `warn` — a distro
shipping a broken icon reference is not ours to shout about, and log volume is
the entire point.

## Metrics

All metrics are namespaced `tv_shell_` and carry `# HELP`/`# TYPE` lines. The
exposition text is rendered **once** by `metrics::render` and shared between the
textfile writer and `/metrics`, so the two never drift.

> **Resource gauges are a convenience.** `tv_shell_cpu_percent`,
> `tv_shell_mem_*`, `tv_shell_load1`, and `tv_shell_temperature_celsius`
> are reused from the daemon's existing sys-metrics reader. If a **node_exporter
> is present on the host, prefer its** `node_cpu_*` / `node_memory_*` /
> `node_hwmon_temp_*` — they are more complete and authoritative. The genuinely
> valuable, daemon-specific signal is the **counters** below, which node_exporter
> cannot provide.

### Metric catalogue

| Metric | Type | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tv_shell_build_info` | gauge | `sha`, `branch`, `version` | Currently deployed revision. Standard info-metric: value is always `1`, identity is in the labels. Resolved **live on each render** from the same provenance as the `/screenshot` `X-TvShell-*` headers and `/dev/status`, so a `/dev/deploy` HEAD swap shows up on the next render. |
| `tv_shell_input_events_total` | counter | — | Raw gamepad evdev events read and processed by the input runtime (hot path). |
| `tv_shell_intents_emitted_total` | counter | — | Shell intents broadcast (`intent:<name>`) — IPC, HTTP `/intent/*`, MCP `send_intent`, and gamepad Home-tap/Home-hold all funnel through one chokepoint. |
| `tv_shell_transitions_total` | counter | — | Shell↔game presenter transitions (`grab`/`release`/`handoff`). |
| `tv_shell_pad_joins_total` | counter | — | Gamepads that joined the fleet (hot-join or initial enumeration). |
| `tv_shell_pad_leaves_total` | counter | — | Gamepads that left the fleet (disconnect). |
| `tv_shell_shell_restarts_total` | counter | — | Daemon starts observed this boot session (the daemon re-execs on `/dev/restart-daemon` and is otherwise supervised, so this is the input-daemon restart count). |
| `tv_shell_input_runtime_up` | gauge | — | Input-runtime liveness: `1` while the supervised input event loop is running, `0` during a respawn gap or after it has panicked past its retry budget (the daemon stays alive; IPC input commands then reply `error:input-runtime-down`). Always emitted. |
| `tv_shell_input_runtime_restarts_total` | counter | — | **In-process** input-runtime respawns after a caught panic — the supervisor rebuilds the input event loop (fresh fleet → released grabs) without re-execing the daemon. Distinct from `tv_shell_shell_restarts_total` (whole-process starts); a rising value flags a recurring panic in the input path. |
| `tv_shell_grab_invariant_violations_total` | counter | — | Detected grab-state drift: a pad's physical `EVIOCGRAB` disagreed with the presenter policy (`should_grab`) after a transition. Should stay `0`; nonzero means the daemon's grab bookkeeping and the kernel diverged. |
| `tv_shell_deploy_total` | counter | `outcome` (`ok`\|`error`) | `POST /dev/deploy` attempts via the HTTP bridge, split by success/failure. |
| `tv_shell_build_total` | counter | — | `POST /dev/build` attempts via the HTTP bridge. |
| `tv_shell_restart_shell_total` | counter | — | `POST /dev/restart-shell` attempts via the HTTP bridge. |
| `tv_shell_restart_daemon_total` | counter | — | `POST /dev/restart-daemon` (re-exec) requests via the HTTP bridge. Counted before the process image is replaced; the re-exec'd process starts its own counters at zero. |
| `tv_shell_quickshell_multi_instance_total` | counter | — | Times a shell restart (`POST /dev/restart-shell` or MCP `restart_shell`) found **more than one live** `quickshell` process after the restart settle — the #254 stacked-instance bug. Zombies (`<defunct>`) are excluded so the metric cannot cry wolf on the path it monitors. Should stay `0`. |
| `tv_shell_quickshell_warnings_total` | counter | — | WARN/ERROR lines the Quickshell QML process wrote to `/tmp/qs-log.txt` (#441). Makes the signal-to-noise invariant below **alertable**. Sampled by a background scanner every 15s, never inside `render` — see [Counting a truncated log monotonically](#counting-a-truncated-log-monotonically). |
| `tv_shell_cpu_percent` | gauge | — | Aggregate CPU utilisation 0..=100. _Convenience — prefer node_exporter._ |
| `tv_shell_mem_used_bytes` | gauge | — | Used memory in bytes. _Convenience._ |
| `tv_shell_mem_total_bytes` | gauge | — | Total memory in bytes. _Convenience._ |
| `tv_shell_load1` | gauge | — | 1-minute load average. _Convenience._ |
| `tv_shell_temperature_celsius` | gauge | `sensor` | Per-sensor hardware temperature (e.g. `sensor="CPU Tctl"`). _Convenience._ |

### Option A — node_exporter textfile collector (primary)

A background task periodically renders the exposition text and writes it
**atomically** (temp file + `rename(2)`, as the textfile collector requires) to a
`.prom` file.

| Config key (`[observability]`) | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `metrics_textfile` | _omitted_ → **writer disabled** | Absolute path to the `.prom` file to write (e.g. `/var/lib/node_exporter/textfile/tv-shell.prom`). |
| `metrics_interval` | `15` | Render/write interval in seconds. `0` falls back to the default. |

When `metrics_textfile` is omitted, **no file is written** — the textfile path is
opt-in. The `/metrics` HTTP route is unaffected by this setting.

Point node_exporter's textfile collector at the file's **directory** (see
[`examples/README.md`](../examples/README.md)).

### Option B — scrape `/metrics` (portable alternative)

When the HTTP bridge is bound (`[http].bind` in config.toml), it serves:

```
GET /metrics  →  200, Content-Type: text/plain; version=0.0.4; charset=utf-8
```

This route **bypasses the bearer-token auth** (scrapers don't send tokens) and
exposes only aggregate counters + resource gauges (no screen content, no
control). It is always available and cheap. See
[`examples/prometheus-scrape.yaml`](../examples/prometheus-scrape.yaml).

```bash
curl -s http://<host>:<port>/metrics
```
