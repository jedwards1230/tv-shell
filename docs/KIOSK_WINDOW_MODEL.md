# Kiosk Window Model

How tv-shell guarantees the kiosk contract on Hyprland, why the previous
reactive approach kept failing, and how the current implementation makes it
structural.

## Audio ownership follows workspace ownership

The screen is not the only thing an app can hold while backgrounded. Once each
app owned a workspace, the sound contract could be stated in the same terms as
the picture contract:

> **You hear the workspace that is on screen, and nothing else.**

`shell/components/WorkspaceAudioMuter.qml` mutes the PipeWire playback streams
of every app that is not on the displayed workspace, and unmutes them when its
workspace comes back. The decision is pure and headlessly tested in
`shell/components/audioOwnership.js` / `tests/qml/tst_audioownership.qml`; the
rule has no special case for the home screen, because home owns the reserved,
deliberately empty workspace 1 and no window's workspace can ever equal it — so
everything falls on the "not on screen" side and goes quiet.

There is no per-app allowlist, and adding an app requires no change here.

### Why the previous version looked random

It muted one hard-coded window class, `"steam"`, whenever `shellState ===
"idle"`. Three things were wrong with that, and the second is why the symptom
came and went:

1. **It matched the wrong window.** Steam Remote Play's live game window has
   class `streaming_client`, and `"streaming_client"` does not contain
   `"steam"` — `str-e-am` versus `st-e-am`. So it engaged for Big Picture and
   never for the window the game audio belongs to.
2. **It reasoned over a single `runningAppClass`** — the last-resumed app. Under
   one-workspace-per-app several apps run at once, each on its own workspace.
   Nothing ever muted Plex.
3. **`shellState === "idle"` is not "the shell is on screen."** It predates the
   workspace model and misses overlay states. What the user is looking at is now
   exactly the active workspace id.

It also emitted a "Stream muted" / "Stream unmuted" toast. That reported a
routine internal consequence of switching workspaces; it is gone.

### Attributing a PipeWire node to a window

A playback stream does not say which window owns it, and the obvious mappings do
not survive contact with Steam. Measured on a live box running Plex, Big Picture
and a Remote Play stream at once:

| Approach | Result |
|---|---|
| PipeWire client pid == Hyprland window pid | Exact for Plex. **Fails for both Steam windows** — Big Picture's window pid is a `steamwebhelper` that owns no PipeWire client. |
| Walk the audio pid's process ancestry | **Fails.** The stream's audio sits under `streaming_client → reaper → IPC:CSteamEngine → steam`, a branch that never passes through the window's pid. They are siblings, not ancestors. |
| `application.name` / `node.name` | **Misleads.** On the Remote Play stream node both are literally `"Steam"` — the same token as the Big Picture window class, collapsing two workspaces into one. |
| `application.process.binary` | **Works.** The real executable name lined up with the window class for all three apps, with no cross-attribution. |

Hence a strict pass on the binary, and — only when that names nothing — a loose
pass on the display names:

| binary | class | related? |
|---|---|---|
| `Plex` | `tv.plex.Plex` | yes (class contains binary) |
| `steam` / `steamwebhelper` | `steam` | yes |
| `streaming_client` | `streaming_client` | yes (exact) |
| `streaming_client` | `steam` | **no** — the discrimination the whole design rests on |

The loose pass exists for one real state, observed live: **a stream process
outliving its window, still holding a playing node.** Strict finds no class for
it (the window is gone), loose credits it to `steam` via `"Steam"`, and it is
muted everywhere except the Steam workspace. Running strict first is what stops
the loose pass from stealing a live stream away from its own workspace.

### The user can override it, and their override wins

The automatic policy owns every app the user has not spoken about. The nav
drawer's X popover lets them mute an app by hand, and that mute is **sticky and
beats the policy**: a user-muted app stays muted even when its workspace is
displayed, until they clear it. A manual mute the policy stomped on the next
workspace switch would be worse than having no manual mute at all.

`desiredMutedIds` is the union of the policy set and the user set. Because a
user-muted class is always in the desired set, `reconcile` can never place it in
the unmute list — the release path cannot revoke a user's choice as a side
effect. That is structural, not a check somewhere. The user's mutes also apply
when the active workspace is **unknown**: policy needs to know what is on screen,
a manual mute does not, and a shell restart must not silently unmute what the
user muted. Persisted in `settings.json` as `mutedApps`, keyed by window class so
the mute survives the app closing and reopening.

**A user mute and an adopted mute must never be confused.** An adopted mute
(above) is one whose *author is unknown*; a user mute is a recorded choice.
Adoption populates the applied set of node ids and never writes back into the
user's list — only the drawer does. Were adoption to manufacture a user mute, the
user would end up with an app they never muted and no obvious way out.

### The drawer's mute indicator, and the one that was deliberately removed

Each running-app row in the drawer can show a single glyph, 🔇, conditionally
rendered — so a row you have not muted looks exactly as it did before this
existed. It means **the user muted this app by hand**, never the policy mute:
the policy mutes nearly every app at any moment, so rendering it would light up
every row while carrying no information.

There was briefly a second indicator — a speaker, meaning "this app has a live
playback stream" — and **removing it is worth recording, because the reasoning
generalises.** It was answering *"what is making noise that I cannot hear?"*, and
that is a question this policy has already made unaskable: the app on screen is
the only one you can hear, by construction. An indicator whose answer the system
guarantees is not information, it is reassurance, and it cost a live PipeWire
attribution path into the drawer, a ~12s anti-flicker latch, a per-row activity
flag, and a republish comparison to stop the audio sweep rebuilding the nav list
under the user's thumb. All of it deleted with the icon.

What survived the deletion, because it fixed real bugs independent of any icon:
the drawer's row focus is keyed on the app's **window address** rather than a row
index (see below), and `runningWindows` remains signature-gated upstream, so the
row model now republishes only on genuine membership or ordering changes.

### Where the rule deliberately stands down

Two exemptions, both narrow and both load-bearing:

- **The shell's own audio.** Settings ▸ Audio's speaker test execs `pw-play`,
  which has no window and so attributes to nothing — it would be muted as an
  orphan, and the user would press "test the centre channel" and hear silence.
  `SHELL_OWNED_BINARIES` in `audioOwnership.js` exempts it, matched **exactly**
  against `application.process.binary` so it cannot quietly widen. This is not a
  per-app allowlist returning: the rule is about *apps*, and an app is a thing
  with a window.
- **While the shell is `streaming` or `reconnecting`.** `runningWindows` is
  refreshed by `AppLifecycleManager`'s `windowPollTimer`, which runs only in
  `idle`/`appRunning`, and Moonlight is launched as a bare `Process` that never
  goes through `showWorkspace()`. So in those states the workspace model stops
  describing the screen, and reconciling against it would find the live stream's
  audio unattributable and mute it. `WorkspaceAudioMuter.shellState` mirrors that
  poll gate on purpose. The coupling previously existed *by accident* — a frozen
  window list happened to mean no cycle ever fired — so widening the poll gate
  would have silently silenced streams. It is now enforced rather than lucky.

### Surviving a shell restart

Mutes live in the PipeWire graph and **outlive the shell process**; the set of
ids the shell holds muted does not. "Only unmute what we muted" is what keeps
this component from touching audio it has no business touching, and within a
session it is exactly right — but across a restart it strands. A node the
previous instance muted is one the new instance will never release, because it
starts with an empty applied set and no memory of setting it.

That is not an exotic path. **Restarting Quickshell is the deploy loop**, so
every deploy that happened while an app was backgrounded left that app
permanently silent, and going home and back could not clear it. Observed in the
field on 2026-08-26: a live stream on the *displayed* workspace, playing to a
muted node.

So the first cycle **adopts** whatever it finds already muted
(`adoptableMutedIds`). The previous instance is the only plausible author — the
shell's own volume control mutes the *sink*, not individual streams — and
reconciliation then releases it the moment its workspace is displayed. Adopting a
mute we did not set is recoverable; stranding one is not. The shell's own test
tone is excluded, since adopting it would mean unmuting it later: the same
overreach in the other direction.

No headless test could have caught this. It exists only across a process
boundary — which is the argument for verifying on the device rather than
declaring victory on a green suite.

`displayedWorkspace` starts **unknown (`""`)**, not `"1"`, and is seeded once
from `hypr-monitors` at startup. Restarting Quickshell is the normal deploy loop
and can happen while an app owns the screen; a `"1"` default would assert "home
is up" until the first switch arrived and mute the app the user is watching. An
unknown workspace means no policy, so nothing is touched until the truth arrives.

### Two consequences, stated rather than buried

- **A node that attributes to nothing is muted.** That is deliberate — an
  orphaned stream must go quiet on the home screen, and "unattributable" is
  exactly what an orphan looks like. The cost is that if attribution ever failed
  for the app you are *looking at*, you would get video with no sound. That is
  the direction a miss falls.
- **Music in a backgrounded app is muted while the home screen is up**, so the
  Now Playing widget can show a track you cannot hear. That follows directly
  from the rule; if it ever needs an exception, the exception belongs in
  `audioOwnership.js`, not in a per-app list.

Reconciliation is **event-driven plus a 5-second sweep**, and the sweep is not
belt-and-braces. The component's inputs are the displayed workspace and the
window set, and neither moves when a backgrounded app simply *begins* playing —
Plex rolling into the next episode, or a Steam stream reconnecting with a fresh
node while the user sits on the home screen. Reacting only to the screen changing
cannot deliver "you never hear what you cannot see"; the graph has to be looked
at too. The cadence matches `windowPollTimer`, and when nothing changed the diff
is empty and no `wpctl` runs at all.

The graph is read with `pw-dump` and parsed as real JSON in QML — not scraped
from `wpctl status`, and not filtered through `jq` (which is not a declared
dependency). That is a safety decision: this policy enumerates the whole graph,
and a mis-parsed id from a text scrape could land on the output **sink** and
silence the box. Only `media.class == "Stream/Output/Audio"` — an app's own
sink-inputs — is ever a candidate, and only ids the shell itself muted are ever
unmuted.

## When the model meets real conditions

Two failures found while verifying the audio work, both about the window model
rather than the sound. Neither has a proven root cause; what follows is
deliberately defensive, and says so.

### An output loss destroys windows while their processes survive

An HDMI link drop — `drm: Connector … disconnected`, with Quickshell falling
back to `There are no outputs - creating placeholder screen` — **destroys the app
windows on that output while their processes keep running.** Observed ~10 times
in one session on a TV behind an AV receiver. The window is gone for good, so the
app is permanently unreachable: resume correctly has nothing to switch to, and it
keeps producing audio from a window nobody can find. It ignored `SIGTERM`.

**This is where orphaned audio comes from.** The orphan case the audio policy
handles is not an edge case; it is the steady-state result of a TV link drop.

The daemon now reconciles on `monitoradded`, so the layout self-repairs instead
of waiting for a daemon restart, and it **names the windows that did not come
back** by diffing a snapshot taken when the output went away — turning a silent
ghost into one journal line.

Deliberately **not** done, and why:

- **No auto-killing of orphaned processes.** That is somebody's live game
  session, and a wrong guess costs them their progress. The audio policy already
  removes the audible symptom.
- **No UI surfacing yet.** Doing it properly needs pid tracking the daemon does
  not have, plus an affordance for acting on it. A detector with nothing to do is
  worse than none.

The bookkeeping lives in `MonitorWatch` (`daemon/src/hyprland.rs`) because the
sequencing, not the diff, is where the bugs are: an **unreadable** client list
must never diff (empty looks identical to "everything was destroyed", and a
monitor add lands mid-DRM-handshake — exactly when a request is likeliest to time
out); the **first** removal wins (both outputs run into one receiver, so a drop
arrives as remove, remove, add, add); snapshots **expire** (a TV off for the
evening must not blame an output change for every app closed since); and
reconciles are **debounced** (Hyprland emits the v1 and v2 add together, and each
reconcile is awaited on the event reader, which is deaf while it runs).

### The park path could not explain itself

A genuine split view appeared — two classes sharing a workspace, which this model
is supposed to make unrepresentable — with **no park line in the journal**, while
the event socket was connected and the daemon had neither restarted nor panicked.
That leaves "the park task was never spawned" or "it was spawned and hung", and
**the evidence cannot separate them.** No root cause is claimed here.

It could not be separated because `park_window` had more silent exits than logged
ones. All of these are now closed:

| Silent exit | Now |
|---|---|
| `request()` had **no timeout at all** — `read_to_end` on a connection Hyprland accepts but never writes to waits forever | Bounded, and expiry is logged |
| `tokio::spawn` dropped the `JoinHandle` | A hang and a panic are both logged, with the address |
| `openwindow_address → None` spawned nothing and logged nothing | Logged |
| Park/reconcile lines named only the **class**, never the address | Address included |

That last one is why the evidence is inconclusive: a line naming only a class
cannot be attributed to a window, so "there is no park line for that window" was
never establishable from the journal.

The biggest exposure was not the park path but the **actor**: client, monitor,
active-window and set-mode reads are all awaited inline in its request loop, so a
single hung read wedged the entire Hyprland actor and left every pending IPC
reply unanswered — silently.

`/keyword` is deliberately **exempt** from the IPC budget. It triggers a real
modeset, so seconds are legitimate; sharing the short cap would have been
actively dangerous, because `apply_change` returns early on an error and never
arms the auto-revert, leaving a *slow but successful* mode change live with
nothing scheduled to undo it. That is the black-TV-no-keyboard outcome the revert
timer exists to prevent.

**The contract.** Exactly one app window is visible and fills the screen; the
shell (Quickshell) sits deterministically above/below it; backgrounded apps
(Plex HTPC, Steam) keep running but never share the screen. Two app windows must
never be visible at once.

**Assumptions.** Hyprland ~0.55 (config targets 0.55). The Quickshell shell is a
**layer-shell** surface (`WlrLayershell`, holds `WlrKeyboardFocus.Exclusive`
while mapped) — not a tiled toplevel, so it is unaffected by window rules and
workspace switches and is never a party to the tiling layout. App windows are
ordinary xdg toplevels the tiler owns.

**Stacking.** Hyprland renders a fullscreen window **above the Top layer**
(only the Overlay layer stacks higher), and this model keeps every app window
fullscreen. The shell's main surface therefore lives on the **Overlay layer**
(`shell.qml`, `WlrLayershell.layer: WlrLayer.Overlay`): its `visible:` binding
already encodes "the shell should own or share the screen now" (home/idle, or a
drawer/QAM over an app), so a mapped shell must actually stack above the
fullscreen app — on the default Top layer, `returnToShell()` over a running
local app mapped the home screen *underneath* the app while stealing exclusive
keyboard focus (an invisible shell driving the D-pad), and the over-app drawers
could never display. When an app should own the screen the surface is unmapped,
so Overlay never covers a foregrounded app. The screenshot-flash and
launch-overlay windows use Overlay for the same reason. Every option below is verified against the
Hyprland source (file references inline); anything that did not survive that
check is listed under *Rejected*.

## Why the old reactive model structurally could not win

Everything ran on **one workspace**, and "one app fills the screen" was
maintained by *reacting* to Hyprland's event stream after the tiler had already
laid windows out, from **two independent enforcers**:

1. **Daemon** (`daemon/src/hyprland.rs`): `force_fullscreen` on `openwindow`;
   `enforce_active_fullscreen` (idempotent `fullscreen 0 set`) on
   `closewindow`/`movewindowv2`/`activewindowv2`.
2. **QML** (`AppLifecycleManager.qml`): on launch/resume, `focuswindow` then
   re-assert fullscreen — the resume address-path fired `hyprctl dispatch
   fullscreen 0`, a **non-idempotent toggle**, unconditionally.

The bad state (two app windows tiled side by side) was **representable** because
the single shared workspace lets the tiler split whenever two toplevels coexist
and neither is fullscreen. That gives three structural defects: two enforcers
with no serialization and conflicting semantics (idempotent `set` vs
non-idempotent toggle); a toggle is state-dependent while the layout is shared
and mutable; and once both windows are tiled, no declarative rule re-fullscreens
on focus — only the racy actor could.

**Today's incidents, mapped:**
1. *Split view on Steam resume (Plex backgrounded).* Resuming an already-
   fullscreen app ran `focuswindow` (Hyprland, via `on_focus_under_fullscreen=1`,
   correctly kept it fullscreen) → then QML's unconditional `fullscreen 0` toggle
   flipped it back **out** → both apps tiled → tiler split. Reproduces even with
   a healthy daemon; killing Plex "fixed" it because close-path enforcement then
   ran with a single window and no racing partner.
2. *Daemon deaf to a restarted Hyprland (>1h).* `resolve_hypr_signature()`
   trusted an inherited `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE` without a liveness check, so
   a long-lived `systemd --user` daemon stayed pinned to the dead instance after a
   render-hang kill+restart; reconnect backoff re-resolved the same stale
   signature forever. Silent — nothing surfaced it.
3. *Presenter flapped Shell↔Game* during the incident-1 focus churn — a symptom
   of reacting to a racing event stream.
4. *HDMI/CEC flap wedges Hyprland's render loop* (hyprctl still answers, frames
   frozen); kill+restart is the only recovery, which then triggers incident 2.

## The fix: declarative-first, single idempotent backstop, self-healing daemon

Remove the tiler's freedom to reach the bad state, collapse enforcement to one
idempotent authority, and make the daemon's compositor attachment self-heal.

**Declarative kiosk rules** (`config/hyprland.conf`, all verified against source):
- `windowrule = fullscreen on, match:class .+` — force every app window
  fullscreen at map (best-effort; gated on winning initial focus).
- `windowrule = suppress_event fullscreen maximize, match:class .+` — the kiosk
  owns fullscreen; ignore a window's own fullscreen/maximize *requests* so a game
  toggling fullscreen can't churn compositor state. `suppress_event` blocks only
  the window's requests, not `hyprctl dispatch`, so the daemon/keybinds keep
  control (`src/desktop/view/Window.cpp`).
- `misc:on_focus_under_fullscreen = 1` — focusing a window under a fullscreen one
  atomically un-fullscreens the old and fullscreens the new; the correct resume
  swap (`src/desktop/state/FocusState.cpp`).
- `misc:exit_window_retains_fullscreen = true` — closing a fullscreen app
  promotes the survivor to fullscreen natively; the declarative form of the
  daemon's old close-path enforcement (`src/config/values/ConfigValues.cpp`).

**Launch-time atomic placement** (`AppLifecycleManager.qml`): the app launch
dispatches `hyprctl dispatch exec [fullscreen] <cmd>`, so the app's first window
maps fullscreen from the start with nothing to correct post-hoc (exec-rule
syntax: `src/config/supplementary/executor/Executor.cpp`).

**Single enforcer** (`AppLifecycleManager.qml`): the QML `fullscreen 0` toggle
and its `hypr-active` read (`ensureFullscreen`/`ensureFullscreenQuery`) are
**removed**. `on_focus_under_fullscreen=1` + the daemon's idempotent `fullscreen
0 set` are now the only things that ever change fullscreen — the incident-1 root
cause is gone.

**Amendment (#347) — the resume path re-asserts fullscreen, idempotently.** The
statement above held only while every window mapped fullscreen. Prewarm (#238)
broke that premise: it launches apps with the `[silent]` exec rule, which maps
them **tiled** (`fs=0`), so the kiosk now deliberately carries a second,
non-fullscreen window from boot. Focusing a tiled window that sits *under* a
fullscreen one changes focus but not what is on screen — the resumed app is
focused-but-invisible, and when `on_focus_under_fullscreen` and the daemon's
`activewindowv2` backstop both miss, nothing else ever corrects it.

So `AppLifecycleManager` again asserts fullscreen after a resume — but with the
**idempotent `set` form** (`hyprctl dispatch fullscreen 0 set`), never the bare
toggle #308 removed. This is not a reversal of #308: the toggle *inverted* state,
so firing it at an already-fullscreen window flipped it back out (incident 1),
and whether it helped depended on who won the race. `set` *assigns* state, so it
is a no-op against a window that is already fullscreen and cannot invert
anything — two idempotent writers of the same state cannot race into a wrong
result the way a toggle and a setter could. It is the same form, for the same
reason, that `force_fullscreen` / `enforce_active_fullscreen` use in
`daemon/src/hyprland.rs`, and it targets the **active** window (no address
selector) exactly as `enforce_active_fullscreen` does.

**Focus landing is now verified, because an exit code cannot.** `hyprctl
dispatch` exits 0 even when its selector matched no window, so a focus that hit
nothing was structurally indistinguishable from one that worked. After a resume
dispatch the shell reads the daemon's `hypr-active` once (a single delayed read,
not a retry loop) and logs a `origin=resume-verify` trace line when the window
that became active is not the one it aimed at. Relatedly, the address-resolution
miss in `focusByAddress` no longer returns silently: it logs
(`origin=resume`) and falls back to a class-targeted focus, since an address
absent from the poll snapshot usually means the snapshot is stale rather than
that the app is gone. The decision + verification logic is pure and headlessly
tested in `shell/components/resumeFocus.js` (`tests/qml/tst_resumefocus.qml`).

Reconciling prewarm's `[silent]` mapping with the kiosk invariant — i.e. whether
prewarmed windows should map differently in the first place — is **deferred**
(#347 item 4).

**Amendment — the single-workspace premise is now asserted, not assumed.**
Everything above holds *"by construction on a single workspace"*, and until now
nothing enforced that clause. There is no `default_workspace`, no workspace
windowrule, no workspace keybind, and there was not one `dispatch workspace` or
`movetoworkspace` call anywhere in the shell or the daemon — so the premise was a
belief about the box, with no invariant check, no telemetry, and no recovery.

It was already false in the field. Observed on the reference deployment
(2026-08-25): Plex HTPC on workspace 1, Steam Big Picture on workspace 4, and
the monitor **displaying workspace 2, which held no windows at all**. Because
the shell is a layer-shell surface it draws regardless of workspace, so the home
screen looked perfectly healthy — but the instant a resume unmapped it, there
was genuinely nothing beneath to render and the TV went black. `dispatch
focuswindow` could not rescue it: it does not reliably follow across workspaces
([hyprwm/Hyprland#1611](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/1611)), the
same issue cited under Phase 2 below. What put the windows there is **still
unknown** — which is precisely why the consolidation below logs every move
rather than self-healing silently.

The resume path therefore reads `hypr-monitors` for the displayed workspace and,
when its target has drifted elsewhere, dispatches
`movetoworkspace <displayed>,address:<addr>` *before* focusing
(`resumeFocus.resolveWorkspaceMove`, pure and headlessly tested in
`tests/qml/tst_resumefocus.qml`).

**Consolidate, not follow.** Switching the display to the window
(`dispatch workspace N`) would also resume correctly, but it accepts a
multi-workspace box permanently and keeps the active-but-empty workspace
reachable forever. Pulling the window onto the displayed workspace drains stray
workspaces back toward one every time the user resumes anything, which restores
the premise the rest of this document depends on. Every branch that cannot
establish *both* the target's workspace and the displayed one declines to move
and focuses anyway — degrading to exactly the pre-change behaviour, since a
`movetoworkspace` aimed at the wrong workspace would relocate a live window
off-screen, which is the failure being fixed.

**A verified miss now recovers.** `resume-verify` used to log and stop. But by
that point `appLaunched()` has already unmapped the shell, so a resume that
provably did not land leaves the TV showing whatever is underneath — in the
incident above, nothing. The shell now emits `resumeFailed` and returns to the
home screen (`resume-abandoned`). It is deliberately **not** `appClosed`: the app
is still running, and only the shell's belief that it came forward was wrong.

**Resumes are generationed, because a verified miss now ACTS.** A resume is a
chain of async hops — decide → read `hypr-monitors` → maybe `movetoworkspace` →
focus → settle → read `hypr-active` → judge — and every hop is a place a second
resume can start. All the state carrying one (`_pendingResumeDecision`,
`_pendingFocusDecision`, the move's `pending`, the shared verify timer) is
single-slot, and nothing recorded which resume owned which reply. Resuming two
apps in quick succession therefore let the first resume's verification judge
itself against compositor state the second had produced:

```
origin=resume-workspace address=0x…027310 workspace=2      (Steam)
origin=resume-workspace address=0x…bdc010 workspace=2      (Plex)
origin=resume-verify mode=address wanted=0x…027310 active=tv.plex.Plex
  reason=active-address-mismatch
origin=resume-abandoned mode=address wanted=0x…027310

Both consolidations were correct; only the bookkeeping crossed. This was latent
for as long as a miss merely logged — a crossed verification was a spurious
journal line nobody chased. Giving that branch a *consequence* is what promoted it
to a bug, which is why the fix ships in the same change.

`AppLifecycleManager._resumeGeneration` is bumped by every `focusByAddress` and
stamped onto the decision (`resumeFocus.stamp`); each hop drops its work once the
stamp is no longer current (`resumeFocus.isStale`). Suppression, not cancellation:
a superseded chain's dispatches were already issued and are harmless — the newer
resume's own dispatches land after them and win. What must not happen is a stale
chain reaching a *conclusion*. The drop is silent by design; a resume the user
replaced is not a fault, and logging it would train us to ignore real
`resume-verify` lines. An unstamped decision is treated as current, so a caller
that never opted into generations still works.

**Companion windows (Steam Remote Play).** Launching a game via Remote Play maps
the live video in a `streaming_client` toplevel while Big Picture stays mapped
behind it. Both get a drawer row, and that is correct — they are two different
destinations. What was wrong is the companion's **icon**: `streaming_client` has
no desktop entry, so the enumerator's class-name icon fallback resolves to nothing
and the row renders a blank letter-tile, unrecognisable as the game the user is
looking for. `appQuirks.identifyCompanionWindows` gives it the owner's icon
(falling back to the owner's class name when Big Picture is not mapped) and
changes nothing else — same rows, same order, same addresses and titles.

**Self-healing daemon** (`daemon/src/session_env.rs`, `hyprland.rs`): signature
resolution scans `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hypr/` for the live socket dir *before*
trusting an inherited env var, so a reconnect re-attaches to a restarted Hyprland
(kills incident 2). Connect-time logging names the attached instance; five
consecutive failed reconnects escalate to a loud `error!` naming the deaf-daemon
condition.

Together these make the contract hold **by construction on a single workspace**:
every window is fullscreen at map and can't un-fullscreen itself; focus swaps are
atomic; closes promote the survivor; and the one actor that broke it is gone. No
frame ever shows two tiled app windows.

## Evaluation of the proposed lockdown ideas

| Idea | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Launch-time atomic `[fullscreen]` placement | **Adopted** | Highest-leverage; app is fullscreen at map. Launching is QML (`hyprctl dispatch exec`), not the daemon — `intent app:` just routes to QML. |
| `suppress_event fullscreen maximize` | **Adopted** | Effect name is `suppress_event` (underscored) in 0.55.2's `WindowRuleEffectContainer.cpp` EFFECT_STRINGS; the legacy `windowrulev2` spelling `suppressevent` fails config parse on-device. Tokens (`fullscreen`/`maximize`) verified in `Window.cpp`. `activate` deliberately **not** suppressed — `focus_on_activate`/launch-focus rely on it; focus-steal is prevented structurally by the fullscreen invariant instead. |
| `new_window_takes_over_fullscreen = 2` | **Rejected** | **Does not exist** in Hyprland 0.55 (`ConfigValues.cpp` has no such key) — setting it errors in `hyprctl configerrors`. Its intent is covered by the fullscreen windowrule + `on_focus_under_fullscreen`; adopted `exit_window_retains_fullscreen` (a real option) instead. |
| Dynamic per-class `windowrulev2` from the daemon | **Rejected (obviated)** | The wildcard `match:class .+` already applies to every class; runtime per-class registration adds churn for no coverage gain. |
| Strip default Hyprland binds | **N/A (already satisfied)** | Hyprland ships **no** default keybinds; the kiosk config already declares only the super-intent set + `SUPER,Q`. Nothing to strip. |
| `idleinhibit fullscreen` windowrule | **Rejected** | Every app is always fullscreen, so this would inhibit idle for *any* running app and defeat the shell's configurable sleep timer (Power page). Media players already send the Wayland idle-inhibit protocol when actually playing — the nuance a blanket rule loses. |
| Compositor watchdog in the daemon | **Partial (Phase 1) / Phase 2** | The event-socket-dead case (incident 2) is now detected + escalated. The render-wedge (incident 4 — frozen frames while `hyprctl` still answers) is **not** IPC-observable from the daemon; detecting it needs a render-side heartbeat (Phase 2). Auto-heal (kill Hyprland → restart plasmalogin → restart daemon) is Phase 2. |
| "Running apps" list in the NavigationDrawer | **Phase 2 (UI, not implemented)** | The daemon window model already exposes everything it needs — each running window's `address`, `class`, `workspace`, `focusHistoryId` via `hypr-clients`. So `A` → `focusByAddress` (today) or `dispatch workspace N` (under Phase-2 isolation) is a race-free switch. Phase 1 does not paint it into a corner. |

**Shell-side selective idle-inhibitor (#195, implemented).** Instead of the
rejected blanket `idleinhibit fullscreen` windowrule, the shell asserts a Wayland
idle-inhibitor only when it *knows* video is playing: its own `streaming` state,
or an `appRunning` app while an MPRIS player reports Playing (Plex/mpv) —
`IdleInhibitController` computes the policy; a dedicated per-screen `IdleInhibitor`
window in `shell.qml` asserts it. That window is **Background-layer + mapped only
while inhibiting** so it sits below the fullscreen app and preserves Hyprland
direct scanout (an Overlay-layer surface would force compositing). Static app
screens and the idle home screen are deliberately left un-inhibited so a
compositor-level idle daemon (hypridle/DPMS — a system concern outside this repo,
which honors these inhibitors) can still blank them for OLED burn-in protection.

## Interaction with the Steam widget (PR #306)

#306's resume path (`SteamCard`/`MoonlightWidget` → `focusByAddress` →
`appLaunched`) is **unchanged in shape** and **improves** under this work: the
`fullscreen 0` toggle that `focusByAddress` used to trigger is gone, so resuming
Steam while Plex is backgrounded swaps fullscreen atomically instead of splitting.
No API change — `focusByAddress(address)` still focuses the window and emits
`appLaunched`. **Under a future Phase 2 (per-app workspaces)** resume becomes
`dispatch workspace N` (because `dispatch focuswindow` does not reliably follow
across workspaces — [hyprwm/Hyprland#1611](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/1611));
#306 would then read the target window's `workspace` (already in the
`hypr-clients` model) rather than call `focuswindow`. Nothing in #306 needs to
change for the current phase.

## Phase 2 (deferred — the strongest form, needs on-device iteration)

**Per-app-workspace isolation.** Assign each app window its own workspace
(class-grouped, so Steam's splash + main share one) so two app windows can never
occupy the same workspace — the split state becomes *unrepresentable* rather than
merely *prevented*. Launch: `exec [workspace N silent; fullscreen]`. Resume:
`dispatch workspace N` (not `focuswindow`, per #1611). This is a bigger change
(workspace allocation, resume-path rework, Steam multi-window grouping) that
needs on-device iteration, which is why it is deferred rather than shipped blind.
The single-workspace model above already satisfies the contract; isolation is
strictly-stronger insurance. Also Phase 2: the render-wedge heartbeat + auto-heal
watchdog, and the NavigationDrawer running-apps list.

## On-device validation checklist (before merge)

Deploy to the reference deployment and confirm:
- [ ] **Two apps backgrounded, switch between them, never a split view.** Launch
  Plex HTPC, launch Steam (Plex backgrounds), resume Plex from a home card, resume
  Steam — each switch shows exactly one fullscreen app, never a side-by-side tile.
- [ ] **App-initiated fullscreen churn is absorbed.** In a game/player, toggle its
  own fullscreen/menu repeatedly — the kiosk stays fullscreen (suppress_event).
- [ ] **Close promotes the survivor.** With two apps running, quit the foreground
  one — the backgrounded app comes forward fullscreen, no split
  (`exit_window_retains_fullscreen`).
- [ ] **Fresh launch is fullscreen immediately** — no visible tiled flash before
  fullscreen (the `[fullscreen]` exec-rule).
- [ ] **Kiosk survives a compositor restart.** Kill + restart Hyprland; confirm the
  daemon re-attaches (journal: `event listener attached to …`), fullscreen
  enforcement + presenter follow-focus resume, and no manual daemon restart is
  needed.
- [ ] **Config parses clean:** `hyprctl configerrors` is empty after reload.
- [ ] Single-app launch/resume still fullscreens correctly with the daemon as the
  only enforcer (QML toggle removed).

## Diagnosing "who launched this window?"

The kiosk contract is violated whenever *two* windows of one app map, or a window
maps unplaced. Both failure modes look identical in the compositor — every launch
the shell issues arrives as a `hyprctl dispatch exec` child of Hyprland, so the
compositor cannot say which of the shell's several launch paths issued it.

The shell therefore traces every app-launch shell-out through one choke point
(`shell/components/AppLifecycleManager.qml`'s `_dispatchExec`, formatted by
`shell/components/launchTrace.js`). One boot's journal answers the question:

```bash
journalctl --user -b -t tv-shell-quickshell | grep 'tv-shell:launch'
```

Each line carries the call path that issued the launch and the window rule it
used:

```
[tv-shell:launch] origin=launch rule=[fullscreen] app=Plex class=tv.plex.Plex comm=plex exec=/usr/bin/Plex
```

| `origin` | Call path | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `launch` | `launchDesktopApp` — foreground launch | `[fullscreen]` |
| `prewarm` | `prewarmApp` — silent login prewarm | `[silent]` |
| `redeliver` | `redeliverAndFocus` — single-instance exec redelivery | `none` |
| `stream` | `StreamManager._launchMoonlight` — direct child, not via `hyprctl` | `none` |
| `prewarm-decision` | the login prewarm pass's one evaluation (what it saw, what it chose) | — |
| `resume` | `focusByAddress` — the address missed the window snapshot: either a class fallback (`mode=class`) or nothing actionable (`mode=none`) | — |
| `resume-workspace` | the resume target was on a different workspace than the display and was consolidated onto it — `address=` moved, `workspace=` destination | — |
| `resume-verify` | a resume focus dispatch that did NOT land — `wanted=` vs `active=` names the miss | — |
| `resume-abandoned` | that miss was recovered by returning to the shell rather than leaving the TV on whatever was underneath | — |

The two `resume*` origins carry no `rule=`/`comm=` (they focus an existing
window rather than exec a new one). They are logged **only on a fault** — a
resume that resolves and lands adds no line, so any `origin=resume*` line in the
journal is itself the finding.

`comm=` is the process name `ps -eo comm=` reports, so a journal line correlates
directly with a live pid. **Two lines with different `origin` values for the same
`comm` is a double launch, and the `origin` names the second culprit.** A launch
logging `rule=none` will not be placed fullscreen at map time — it depends on the
`windowrule = fullscreen` backstop and the daemon's `openwindow` enforcement
instead.
