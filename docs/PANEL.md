# tv-shell-panel — Web Control Panel

`tv-shell-panel` is a LAN-only web control panel for tv-shell: server-rendered
HTML + HTMX over the daemon's existing control surface. It runs as its own
`systemd --user` unit beside the daemon, so it stays available to rebuild or
restart a wedged daemon — the recovery path that previously required remote
config management.

> Status: all four milestones (M1-M4) plus a final-polish pass have landed on
> the `panel-staging` branch — every page is fully implemented. This document
> is the panel's living doc; a final promotion sweep (merging `panel-staging`
> into `main`) is still pending.

## Architecture

- **Crate**: `panel/` (workspace member) → binary `tv-shell-panel`.
- **Stack**: axum + askama templates + vendored `htmx.min.js` (no CDN; the panel
  must render when the network or the rest of the system is broken).
- **Bind**: `[panel]` section in `config.toml` (`enabled`, `bind`, default
  `127.0.0.1:8091`; `token_file` reserved for future auth — v1 is LAN-only).
- **Unit**: `config/tv-shell-panel.service`, installed by `scripts/install.sh`,
  started by the session script.

### Three data tiers

1. **Unix-socket IPC** (primary) — the daemon's newline-text protocol
   (`docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md`): status, system info, storage, settings
   (`get-config`/`set-config` — the daemon remains sole writer of
   `settings.json`), widgets subtree, bluetooth, network, power, CEC,
   controllers/bindings, apps, intents/keys.
2. **Daemon HTTP bridge** (dev ops) — `/dev/deploy|build|restart-shell|
   restart-daemon|logs`, `/screenshot` (`docs/CONTROL_SURFACE.md`).
3. **Direct exec** (recovery + system) — `systemctl --user` restarts,
   `build-daemon.sh` when the daemon is down, `journalctl`, process list,
   reboot/suspend via logind. The UI labels which tier each action uses;
   destructive actions are confirmed and single-flight.

## Pages

| Page | Contents |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | unit status, build info, system/storage tiles, pad fleet, quick actions, an Updates tile (own slow poll — see [System updates](#system-updates-pacman) below) |
| Processes | tv-shell systemd user units (daemon/shell/panel) with per-unit restart (color-coded dot + status word, not just text); Hyprland active window/clients (styled table)/monitors via IPC; a read-only top-processes table (`ps`, CPU-sorted, no kill action in v1); a System Updates section (see below) |
| Settings | grouped typed forms over `settings.json` via `get-config`/`set-config` (shallow merge — unmentioned keys, notably the daemon-owned `keyBindings`/`perGameBindings`/`perPlayerBindings`, are left untouched); those daemon-owned binding keys are shown read-only here (`keyBindings` is also editable via the Controllers page's bindings editor; the per-game/per-player layers are read-only there too — full editors are deferred); read-only `config.toml` view (the edit path is deferred — editing still requires a manual edit + daemon/panel restart via the Dev page); raw JSON escape hatch with an explicit shallow-merge/`null`-deletes warning for keys not modeled as typed fields (e.g. `widgets`, `cecDeviceNames`) |
| Widgets | per-widget enabled/order/size/prefs editors (`widgets.<id>` subtree) |
| Tools | IPC console grouped by domain — Navigation (intent/key), Apps (list/launch/recents), Bluetooth (power/scan/list/connect-disconnect-pair-trust), Network (status/wifi/throughput/ping), Power (can-suspend/battery), System (sys-status/sys-metrics/storage-status/build-info/controllerdb); plus a raw-line escape hatch with a warning on commands owned by another page's guarded flow. CEC and controller/pads/bindings commands live on their own Controllers/CEC pages (below) instead. |
| Controllers | Fleet table (`get-pads`, per-pad battery/rumble-status/bounded rumble test) with a lazy `list-input-devices` diagnostics panel; grab-management (`grab`/`release`/`handoff`) with explanations and confirms on the two that affect the live input path; a bindings editor (`get-bindings`/`set-binding` against the fixed action/button vocabulary, plus a `capture-next`/`capture-cancel` capture-and-apply flow); read-only per-game/per-player binding layers with a `set-active-game`/clear form (editing deferred — use the Settings raw JSON hatch); controller-DB status/refresh |
| CEC | Topology (`cec-scan`/`cec-device`, merged with the `cecDeviceNames` friendly-name overrides from Settings); switching (`cec-active-source` as the "switch input" primitive, per-device `cec-power-on`/`-off`, all confirmed); a health panel (`cec-health`/`cec-test`) classifying the daemon's transmit-wedge state, with an escalating "Recover CEC" ladder (test → restart daemon, reusing the Dev page's bridge-then-exec tier logic → link to a full reboot on Dev) that flags the recommended step for the current state; a build/platform-gated daemon renders as an honest "not available" note, never a failure banner |
| Dev | deploy/build/restart daemon/restart shell/reboot with tier labels + confirms; screenshot viewer (provenance sha/branch/version/captured-at, proxied via `/dev/screenshot`) |
| Logs | shell + daemon log tails (ANSI-stripped — including "bare" ESC-dropped residue like `[33m`/`[0m` — and wrapped rather than clipped), free-text filter plus one-click "Errors only"/"Hide icon noise" presets, and a Focus Shell/Focus Daemon toggle to expand one pane to full width (state lives on `#log-panels` itself, so it survives every htmx refresh of the panes inside it) |

A small daemon-reachability dot lives in the topnav on every page (`base.html`
+ `pages::nav`), polling a cheap, short-timeout `status` probe every ~10s —
green when the daemon answers, red when it doesn't, neutral until the first
poll lands.

## System updates (pacman)

`panel/src/updates.rs` owns pacman system-update state independently of the
daemon — the Dashboard Updates tile and the Processes page's "System
Updates" section both read it.

- **Read** (unprivileged): `checkupdates` (pacman-contrib) parsed into
  `{name, old_version, new_version}` rows. Exit code `2` ("no updates
  available") is an OK-empty result, not an error; exit `1` (or a spawn
  failure/timeout) surfaces as an honest error banner. Cached in `AppState`
  (`UpdatesState`) with a 5-minute TTL — `checkupdates` never runs on the
  Dashboard's fast 5s tile poll (the Updates tile polls on its own, much
  slower 300s interval instead); the Processes page's Refresh button
  bypasses the cache.
- **Reboot-needed detection**: compares `uname -r` against the installed
  kernel package's version. The kernel package is found by filtering
  `pacman -Qq` for `linux`/`linux-<flavor>` names (excluding
  headers/docs/firmware/tools suffixes) and, when several are installed
  (e.g. `linux` + `linux-lts`), matching the flavor suffix against the
  `uname -r` release string. An ambiguous or unparseable result degrades to
  `RebootStatus::Unknown` rather than guessing.
- **Apply** (privileged): `sudo -n pacman -Syu --noconfirm`. Runs as a
  single-flighted `tokio::spawn` background task tracked in `AppState`
  (`Idle` → `Running{started, log_tail}` → `Done{success, finished,
  log_tail}`) — the pacman process outlives any one HTTP request. Combined
  stdout+stderr streams into a live ~200-line tail as the process runs;
  `kill_on_drop` enforces a 30-minute timeout. A second "Run full update"
  click while one is already running is a no-op (the existing job's status
  is shown, not a new one started).
- The Processes page's job-status view polls itself
  (`hx-trigger="every 2s [this.dataset.running=='1']"`) only while
  `Running`; on `Done` it shows success/failure and, if the kernel package
  version no longer matches the running kernel, a reboot-needed banner
  linking to Dev → Reboot.
- No new `config.toml` keys — every threshold (cache TTL, apply timeout, log
  tail length) is a hardcoded constant in `updates.rs`.

### Deployment prerequisite: passwordless sudo for the apply path

**The panel's systemd-unit user needs a NOPASSWD sudoers rule scoped to
`pacman -Syu`** — `-n` ("never prompt") is what makes `sudo -n pacman -Syu
--noconfirm` safe to shell out to from an unattended background task in the
first place; without a real terminal to prompt at, a plain `sudo pacman -Syu`
would otherwise just hang until the 30-minute timeout killed it. htpc-1 (the
reference deploy host) grants this today; a fresh deploy host needs the
equivalent, e.g. a drop-in under `/etc/sudoers.d/`:

```
tv-shell ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pacman -Syu --noconfirm
```

(substitute the actual unit user and `pacman` path for the target host).

**Failure mode when the rule is absent or wrong**: `sudo -n` fails
immediately — no hang, no password prompt — printing something like `sudo: a
password is required` to stderr and exiting non-zero. The apply job captures
that exact line into its log tail, and the UI surfaces it directly: the
Processes page's failure banner shows the last non-empty log line inline
(`last_error_line` in `pages::processes`) rather than a bare "Update failed",
and the log-tail `<details>` auto-expands on a failed run instead of staying
collapsed — so the real cause is visible without an extra click. The
Dashboard Updates tile is unaffected either way, since it only reflects the
unprivileged `checkupdates` read.

## Danger tiers

Mutating buttons across the panel use one of two tiers, distinct from
`--error` (reserved for banners): `.warn-action` (amber-red) for
recoverable-but-disruptive actions — unit restarts, Controllers'
release/handoff, controllerdb refresh — and `.danger-severe` (deep red,
bold border) for actions that take the whole box down or overwrite the
running build — Dev's Reboot/Suspend/Deploy/Build, and the Updates
section's "Run full update". The Processes page's own-unit (panel) Restart
button carries a distinct confirm message noting the click will disconnect
the very page the operator is looking at.

## Running locally

Build with `scripts/build-panel.sh` (outputs to `target/release/tv-shell-panel`)
or `cargo run -p tv-shell-panel` for a dev loop. It reads `[panel]` from
`~/.config/tv-shell/config.toml` and serves on `127.0.0.1:8091` by default (see
`config/config.toml.example`). Installed systems run it as
`tv-shell-panel.service`, started by `scripts/tv-shell-session.sh`.
