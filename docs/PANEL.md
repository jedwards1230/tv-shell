# tv-shell-panel — Web Control Panel

`tv-shell-panel` is a LAN-only web control panel for tv-shell: server-rendered
HTML + HTMX over the daemon's existing control surface. It runs as its own
`systemd --user` unit beside the daemon, so it stays available to rebuild or
restart a wedged daemon — the recovery path that previously required remote
config management.

> Status: all four milestones (M1-M4) have landed on the `panel-staging` branch —
> every page is fully implemented. This document is the panel's living doc; a
> final promotion sweep (merging `panel-staging` into `main`) is still pending.

## Architecture

- **Crate**: `panel/` (workspace member) → binary `tv-shell-panel`.
- **Stack**: axum + askama templates + vendored `htmx.min.js` (no CDN; the panel
  must render when the network or the rest of the system is broken).
- **Bind**: `[panel]` section in `config.toml` (`enabled`, `bind`, default
  `127.0.0.1:8091`; `token_file` reserved for future auth — v1 is LAN-only).
- **Unit**: `config/tv-shell-panel.service`, installed by `scripts/install.sh`,
  started by the session script.

### Three data tiers

1. **Unix-socket IPC** (primary) — the daemon's newline-text protocol
   (`docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md`): status, system info, storage, settings
   (`get-config`/`set-config` — the daemon remains sole writer of
   `settings.json`), widgets subtree, bluetooth, network, power, CEC,
   controllers/bindings, apps, intents/keys.
2. **Daemon HTTP bridge** (dev ops) — `/dev/deploy|build|restart-shell|
   restart-daemon|logs`, `/screenshot` (`docs/CONTROL_SURFACE.md`).
3. **Direct exec** (recovery + system) — `systemctl --user` restarts,
   `build-daemon.sh` when the daemon is down, `journalctl`, process list,
   reboot/suspend via logind. The UI labels which tier each action uses;
   destructive actions are confirmed and single-flight.

## Pages

| Page | Contents |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | unit status, build info, system/storage tiles, pad fleet, quick actions |
| Processes | tv-shell systemd user units (daemon/shell/panel) with per-unit restart; Hyprland active window/clients/monitors via IPC; read-only top-processes snapshot (`ps`, CPU-sorted, no kill action in v1) |
| Settings | grouped typed forms over `settings.json` via `get-config`/`set-config` (shallow merge — unmentioned keys, notably the daemon-owned `keyBindings`/`perGameBindings`/`perPlayerBindings`, are left untouched); those daemon-owned binding keys are shown read-only here (`keyBindings` is also editable via the Controllers page's bindings editor; the per-game/per-player layers are read-only there too — full editors are deferred); read-only `config.toml` view (the edit path is deferred — editing still requires a manual edit + daemon/panel restart via the Dev page); raw JSON escape hatch with an explicit shallow-merge/`null`-deletes warning for keys not modeled as typed fields (e.g. `widgets`, `cecDeviceNames`) |
| Widgets | per-widget enabled/order/size/prefs editors (`widgets.<id>` subtree) |
| Tools | IPC console grouped by domain — Navigation (intent/key), Apps (list/launch/recents), Bluetooth (power/scan/list/connect-disconnect-pair-trust), Network (status/wifi/throughput/ping), Power (can-suspend/battery), System (sys-status/sys-metrics/storage-status/build-info/controllerdb); plus a raw-line escape hatch with a warning on commands owned by another page's guarded flow. CEC and controller/pads/bindings commands live on their own Controllers/CEC pages (below) instead. |
| Controllers | Fleet table (`get-pads`, per-pad battery/rumble-status/bounded rumble test) with a lazy `list-input-devices` diagnostics panel; grab-management (`grab`/`release`/`handoff`) with explanations and confirms on the two that affect the live input path; a bindings editor (`get-bindings`/`set-binding` against the fixed action/button vocabulary, plus a `capture-next`/`capture-cancel` capture-and-apply flow); read-only per-game/per-player binding layers with a `set-active-game`/clear form (editing deferred — use the Settings raw JSON hatch); controller-DB status/refresh |
| CEC | Topology (`cec-scan`/`cec-device`, merged with the `cecDeviceNames` friendly-name overrides from Settings); switching (`cec-active-source` as the "switch input" primitive, per-device `cec-power-on`/`-off`, all confirmed); a health panel (`cec-health`/`cec-test`) classifying the daemon's transmit-wedge state, with an escalating "Recover CEC" ladder (test → restart daemon, reusing the Dev page's bridge-then-exec tier logic → link to a full reboot on Dev) that flags the recommended step for the current state; a build/platform-gated daemon renders as an honest "not available" note, never a failure banner |
| Dev | deploy/build/restart daemon/restart shell/reboot with tier labels + confirms; screenshot viewer (provenance sha/branch/version/captured-at, proxied via `/dev/screenshot`) |
| Logs | shell + daemon log tails (ANSI-stripped, wrapped rather than clipped), free-text filter plus one-click "Errors only"/"Hide icon noise" presets |

A small daemon-reachability dot lives in the topnav on every page (`base.html`
+ `pages::nav`), polling a cheap, short-timeout `status` probe every ~10s —
green when the daemon answers, red when it doesn't, neutral until the first
poll lands.

## Running locally

Build with `scripts/build-panel.sh` (outputs to `target/release/tv-shell-panel`)
or `cargo run -p tv-shell-panel` for a dev loop. It reads `[panel]` from
`~/.config/tv-shell/config.toml` and serves on `127.0.0.1:8091` by default (see
`config/config.toml.example`). Installed systems run it as
`tv-shell-panel.service`, started by `scripts/tv-shell-session.sh`.

## Milestones

- [x] M1 — crate scaffold, IPC client, app shell/nav, Dashboard, Logs, Dev page
- [x] M2 — Settings + Widgets editors
  - [x] Settings editor
  - [x] Widgets editor
- [x] M3 — Tools console, Processes, screenshot viewer
  - [x] Tools console (Navigation/Apps/Bluetooth/Network/Power/System + raw escape hatch)
  - [x] Processes page (systemd units, Hyprland, top processes)
  - [x] Dev screenshot viewer (provenance headers, PNG proxy)
- [x] M4 — Controllers + CEC (switching, grab handling, wedge recovery)
  - [x] Controllers page (fleet/battery/rumble, grab management, bindings editor + capture, per-game/per-player read-only, controller DB)
  - [x] CEC page (topology, switching, health + escalating wedge recovery)
- [x] UI-polish pass (post-M4, live-audit fixups; branch `panel-staging-ui-polish`)
  - [x] Raw `<connection>:<grab>` IPC tokens humanized into plain language + a
        colored state dot (Dashboard tile, Controllers fleet), raw token kept
        as a muted suffix (`panel/src/humanize.rs`)
  - [x] Log panes ANSI-stripped server-side (`panel/src/text.rs`), wrapped
        instead of clipped, plus "Errors only"/"Hide icon noise" preset filters
  - [x] CEC recovery ladder recommends exactly one step, chosen from the
        health classification, instead of flagging every step
  - [x] CEC health panel and Controllers fleet section auto-refresh via htmx
        out-of-band swaps after any CEC action / grab / release / handoff
  - [x] Settings raw-JSON escape hatch pretty-prints on render (15-row
        textarea) and is compacted server-side before `set-config`
  - [x] Settings' persisted binding-override block relabeled to point at
        Controllers for the resolved view
  - [x] Dashboard tiles are whole-tile links to their natural page
  - [x] Global daemon-reachability dot in the topnav (`pages::nav`)
  - [x] `[profile.release]` (`strip = "debuginfo"`, `lto = "thin"`) added to
        the workspace root — trims every workspace binary, daemon/host included
