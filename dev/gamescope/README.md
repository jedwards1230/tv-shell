# gamescope prototype session

A one-week measurement, not a product. It boots [gamescope](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope)
on the DRM backend in place of Hyprland, with the tv-shell input daemon beside it and a
deliberately tiny prototype shell as its primary child, so that the questions below can be
answered with numbers before any v2 architecture is written around gamescope.

Nothing in this directory is used by the real session. It is opt-in, selected at the
display manager, and removable by deleting the directory and the session entry.

## Why gamescope is on the table

The kiosk invariant ("exactly one app fills the screen") has been re-fixed nine times on
Hyprland because the shell asks the compositor questions it answers about a different
object, and a window can decline focus. gamescope's focus is decided by its own policy and
cannot be refused, it has an interactive overlay plane designed for a QAM over a running
game, it never touches gamepads, and it runs headless for CI. What it has *not* proven on
this hardware is 10-bit HDR output at 4K120 and the cost of Vulkan compositing when the
kernel lacks `CONFIG_AMD_PRIVATE_COLOR`. Those two unknowns are cheap to measure and
decisive, hence this kit.

## Pass/fail criteria

| # | Question | How | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Output is 10-bit HDR at 4K120 | `sudo measure.sh` | `output bit depth` PASS, `colorspace` BT2020, `HDR_OUTPUT_METADATA` PASS, `mode` PASS |
| 2 | VRR engages | `sudo measure.sh` | `VRR` PASS |
| 3 | A lone HDR stream is not double-composited | stats FIFO + eyes | frame time steady at the refresh with Moonlight HDR running; no judder |
| 4 | SDR black floor is right | eyes | the black end of the strip at the top of the prototype shell is OLED-black under `--hdr-enabled` |
| 5 | Focus is unrefusable and instant | `launch.sh xmessage`, `focus.sh app 9001`, repeat 20x | every switch lands, nothing tiles, no window "declines" |
| 6 | Overlay over a running app | `launch.sh overlay` | panel visible above the app, app keeps animating, keys go to the panel |
| 7 | Gamepad reaches the shell | press D-pad | `last key` counter climbs in the prototype shell (daemon uinput path works under gamescope) |
| 8 | Moonlight HDR via the WSI layer | `sudo measure.sh` (`HDR to clients`), then `launch.sh moonlight` | `GAMESCOPE_HDR_OUTPUT_FEEDBACK` is 1; stream is HDR on the TV, no fallback to SDR tonemap |
| 9 | Qt on gamescope is usable | eyes | prototype shell renders at full size, no decorations, keyboard focus YES |

Decision rule agreed 2026-09-04: if 1 or 3 fails, gamescope is out for v2 and the
Hyprland-plugin path is next; Smithay stays the v3 target on HDR grounds.

## Install and select

Deployment is site configuration (an Ansible toggle in the private homelab repo installs
`gamescope` and writes `/usr/share/wayland-sessions/tv-shell-gamescope.desktop` whose
`Exec` is `session.sh` here). Without that tooling, the manual equivalent is:

```sh
# as root, on the box
pacman -S gamescope xorg-xprop
printf '%s\n' '[Desktop Entry]' 'Type=Application' 'Name=TV Shell (gamescope prototype)' \
  'Exec=/opt/tv-shell/dev/gamescope/session.sh' 'DesktopNames=gamescope' \
  > /usr/share/wayland-sessions/tv-shell-gamescope.desktop
```

Then pick "TV Shell (gamescope prototype)" at the greeter, or, on an autologin kiosk that
never shows one, point the display manager's autologin session at `tv-shell-gamescope`
for the week. The default boot session is untouched; log out (or set it back) to return to it.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `session.sh` | The session. Starts `tv-shell-input.service`, creates the stats FIFO, execs gamescope with `--steam --expose-wayland --keep-alive -W/-H/-r --hdr-enabled --adaptive-sync`, logs to journal tag `tv-shell-gamescope` |
| `client.sh` | gamescope's primary child. Runs `proto-shell.qml` on X11 with a Qt 6 runtime, tags it `STEAM_GAME=9001`, makes it the base layer, writes `/tmp/tv-shell-gamescope.env` for the SSH-side tools, relaunches it on exit (with backoff once it crash-loops) |
| `lib.sh` | Sourced by `client.sh`, `focus.sh` and `launch.sh`: the Qt 6 `qml` resolver (`qml6`, `/usr/lib/qt6/bin/qml`, `/usr/lib64/qt6/bin/qml`, then a `qml` whose `--version` says 6; `TV_SHELL_GS_QML` overrides) and `gs_tag_pid`, the tag-every-window-of-a-pid watcher (below) |
| `proto-shell.qml` | The prototype shell: shows window size, keyboard focus, last key, a moving dot, and a black-to-white strip |
| `proto-overlay.qml` | Overlay test client, semi-transparent side panel |
| `focus.sh` | `list` / `tag` / `tag-pid` / `app` / `window` / `clear` over gamescope's root X11 atoms. `tag-pid <pid> <id>` tags every window of a pid as it appears (`--timeout`, `--class`, `--log`, `--name`, `--expect`, `--done-name`) |
| `launch.sh` | `overlay` / `x11` / `apps <host>` / `moonlight [--quit]` (X11, every window of its pid tagged `STEAM_GAME=9003`; `--wayland` for the xdg-shell experiment) / `xmessage` into the running session from SSH |
| `measure.sh` | Reads DRM connector properties, debugfs bit depth, the active mode, gamescope's own info (`gamescopectl`, `backend_info`, `help`) and the root feedback atoms, and prints verdicts. Every DRM read is scoped to one connector (the first connected + enabled one, or `TV_SHELL_GS_CONNECTOR=card1-HDMI-A-1` to choose on a two-output box) and to the CRTC driving it. Under `sudo` the gamescope-side reads run as the session user |

## Running a measurement

From another machine, with the prototype session up on the TV:

```sh
ssh box 'sudo /opt/tv-shell/dev/gamescope/measure.sh'          # criteria 1, 2, 8 (signal)
ssh box '/opt/tv-shell/dev/gamescope/launch.sh xmessage hi'     # criterion 5
ssh box '/opt/tv-shell/dev/gamescope/focus.sh app 9001'         # back to the shell
ssh box '/opt/tv-shell/dev/gamescope/launch.sh overlay'         # criterion 6
ssh box '/opt/tv-shell/dev/gamescope/launch.sh apps <host>'     # what the streaming host runs + exact app names
ssh box "/opt/tv-shell/dev/gamescope/launch.sh moonlight stream <host> ' Steam Big Picture' \
    --resolution 3840x2160 --fps 120 --hdr --display-mode fullscreen"   # criteria 3, 8
ssh box 'cat /tmp/tv-shell-gamescope-stats'                     # criterion 3 (a FIFO, see below)
```

First check the journal (`journalctl -t tv-shell-gamescope -b`) for the line
`qml runtime: ... (6.x.y)` from `client.sh`. A `FATAL: no Qt 6 qml runtime found` line
lists what was tried; until it is fixed gamescope presents no frames, the TV is black, and
every DRM verdict from `measure.sh` is an artifact of "no client ever rendered".

`measure.sh` needs `sudo` for the debugfs read, and under `sudo` runs the gamescope-side
reads (`gamescopectl`, `xprop`) as the session user itself. Its `HDR to clients` verdict
is criterion 8's signal: the WSI layer offers HDR swapchains only while the root atom
`GAMESCOPE_HDR_OUTPUT_FEEDBACK` is 1. On 3.16.x that atom is simply
`(EDID says HDR10) && hdr_enabled`, written before any client presents, and the connector
goes to PQ/BT2020 in the same loop iteration, so atom=1 and connector-in-HDR are one boolean.

**Rule: never run `gamescopectl <convar>` without a value.** On gamescope 3.16.x and master
a bare `gamescopectl hdr_enabled` is not a read, it **resets the convar to false** (the
server always passes two arguments and an empty bool parses as false), turning HDR off
for the whole session with no log line. The same holds for every convar (`vrr_enabled`,
`composite_force`, ...). Commands are fine (`gamescopectl` bare, `help`, `backend_info`,
which is all the kit runs). Read convar state from the root atoms instead
(`xprop -root GAMESCOPE_DISPLAY_HDR_ENABLED GAMESCOPE_HDR_OUTPUT_FEEDBACK GAMESCOPE_DISPLAY_SUPPORTS_HDR`)
and set one only with an explicit value. Recovery after an accidental reset:
`gamescopectl hdr_enabled 1`, which `measure.sh` prints whenever `HDR to clients` is FAIL
with `GAMESCOPE_DISPLAY_SUPPORTS_HDR=1`.

The stats path is a **FIFO**, created by `session.sh` and removed with the session.
gamescope only `open()`s an existing one (retrying every 10 s), so it attaches within
10 s of a reader appearing. One reader at a time: `cat` or `tail -f` it, and stop that
reader before starting another. Lines are `fps=<float>` and `focus=<appid>` at about 1 Hz.
`measure.sh` samples it for 4 s, which takes the stream over from any other reader for
that window.

`launch.sh moonlight` runs Moonlight on X11 (`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`, `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11`,
`ENABLE_GAMESCOPE_WSI=1`), sets the base-layer preference to `9003,9001`, then tags
**every X window of Moonlight's pid** `STEAM_GAME=9003` as it appears, so gamescope
switches to the stream the moment its window exists and `focus.sh app 9001` brings the
shell back. Tagging is by pid, not by title, because **the stream is not the window
named "Moonlight"**: that is the Qt main window, which `moonlight stream` unmaps once the
session starts. The stream window is a second X window (`WM_NAME "<host> - Moonlight"`,
`WM_CLASS "moonlight"`, `_NET_WM_PID` = Moonlight's pid) created after the session
handshake, 5-20 s in. Tagging only the first one leaves the stream out of
`GAMESCOPE_FOCUSABLE_APPS` and the TV on the shell for the whole run, which is exactly
what the first phase-3 attempt did. `gs_tag_pid` (lib.sh) re-scans once a second for
up to 60 s and stops once a window named `* - Moonlight` is tagged; each window is
tagged once and printed as `tagged 0x... "<name>" STEAM_GAME=9003 (t+12s)`.

There is no window-enumeration call to lean on: xprop is the only X client here and
gamescope publishes no `_NET_CLIENT_LIST` (`GAMESCOPE_FOCUSABLE_WINDOWS` lists only
windows that already carry a game id). So the watcher collects candidate xids from the
WSI layer's own log lines (`Creating Gamescope surface: xid: 0x...`, written the moment
Moonlight creates the surface), from `GAMESCOPE_FOCUSABLE_WINDOWS` (re-runs), from
`xprop -name` hints, and from the next `TV_SHELL_GS_XID_PROBE` (32) resource ids above
each window it already knows, since an X client allocates ids sequentially. Every
candidate is kept only when its `_NET_WM_PID` is the pid or its `WM_CLASS` carries
`moonlight`. The same helper tags the prototype shell in `client.sh` (title as a hint,
pid as the rule, so a relaunched shell is never confused with a window of the instance
being torn down) and is exposed as `focus.sh tag-pid <pid> <id>` for anything else.

Two things the live run showed about the atoms themselves. `xprop -root _NET_CLIENT_LIST`
answers `no such atom` under gamescope's XWM (the helper tolerates that; it is why the
candidate sources above exist), so a leftover-window check after a client exits has to go
through `xprop -name <title>` or `focus.sh list`, never a client list. And after the stream
quits, `GAMESCOPECTRL_BASELAYER_APPID` still reads `9003, 9001` until `focus.sh app 9001`
clears it; that is cosmetic, since with 9003 gone the shell is already the effective base
layer, but read `GAMESCOPE_FOCUSED_APP`, not the preference, to know what is on screen.

**Ask the streaming host before streaming.** `moonlight stream <host> <app>` while
Sunshine is already running a *different* app pops a "quit the running app?" dialog
inside Moonlight's unmapped GUI and waits forever (the first phase-3 attempt sat for 74 s
with no session lines). `launch.sh moonlight stream ...` therefore reads
`http://<host>:47989/serverinfo` first (`<state>`, `<currentgame>`; port via
`TV_SHELL_GS_SUNSHINE_PORT`), maps the running app id to its name through Moonlight's
own cache (`~/.config/Moonlight Game Streaming Project/Moonlight.conf`), and then:
idle → streams; already running exactly the requested app → streams (Sunshine resumes
it, nothing on the host changes); running something else → **refuses** (exit 3) and
prints the two ways out, resume what is running, or `launch.sh moonlight --quit stream
...` / `launch.sh moonlight quit <host>`, which ends the session on the host. That is
the operator's decision, never the kit's: nothing here quits a running app unless
`--quit` is on the command line. An unreachable serverinfo is a warning, not a refusal
(Moonlight fails fast in that case, it does not hang).

**Sunshine app names may start with a space** (`" Desktop"`, `" Steam Big Picture"` on
the streaming host measured here). The name is passed to Moonlight verbatim, so quote it
with the space: `launch.sh moonlight stream <host> ' Steam Big Picture'`. `launch.sh
apps <host>` prints the host's state, the running app, and every cached name in quotes
(`'  Desktop'`, with `<- running now` on the current one), plus the live `moonlight list
<host>` output the same way, so the exact string can be copied.

X11 is the path that survives here, and the **only** HDR path: gamescope's WSI layer
hardcodes `hdrOutput = false` for native-Wayland surfaces (3.16.23
`layer/VkLayer_FROG_gamescope_wsi.cpp:758`, master `:834`) and gamescope's own Wayland
server offers clients no colour-management protocol, so a Wayland-native Moonlight can
never get HDR under gamescope today. `launch.sh moonlight
--wayland` keeps the xdg-shell experiment for decode/latency comparisons only; Moonlight-qt
6.1.0 did not survive it (below) and it has no focus selector. The one thing to compare
between the two for criterion 3 is hardware decode: Moonlight warns that XWayland "will
probably break hardware decoding", so if the X11 stream falls back to software decode or
judders, `--wayland` is the control run.

The X11 layer exposes HDR10 formats only when the window can bypass XWayland (it must match
its toplevel within 2 px). Success signature in `moonlight.log`: `server hdr output
enabled: true` and `hdr formats exposed to client: true`. If the first is `true` and the
second stays `false`, run `GAMESCOPE_WSI_FORCE_BYPASS=1 launch.sh moonlight` (the variable
is passed through as-is). If the first is `false`, the root atom is 0: see the rule above.

Tunables are environment variables read by `session.sh` (`TV_SHELL_GS_HDR=0` for an SDR
control run, `TV_SHELL_GS_SDR_NITS`, `TV_SHELL_GS_EXTRA` for any other gamescope flag).
Set them in the session entry's `Exec` line, e.g. `Exec=env TV_SHELL_GS_HDR=0 /opt/tv-shell/dev/gamescope/session.sh`.

### First live results (2026-09-05)

One target box, gamescope 3.16.23, a 7.2-series kernel, an AMD GPU through an AVR to the
TV. The base layer was the kit's own prototype shell (SDR, X11). Verdicts of the first
pass (the phase-3 re-run with the fixed kit follows):

| # | Criterion | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10-bit HDR at 4K120 | PASS on what is measurable: colorspace `BT2020_RGB`, `HDR_OUTPUT_METADATA` blob with EOTF = PQ, mode `3840x2160 120.00`. **Bit depth is unmeasurable on this kernel**: debugfs `output_bpc` prints only `Maximum: 12` (no `Current:`), gamescope sets `max bpc` to 16 (a requested cap), `gamescopectl` has no output-format command and the gamescope log never states the scanout depth. Only the TV's info panel can answer it |
| 2 | VRR engages | PASS: `VRR_ENABLED=1`, `backend_info` `VRR Active: true`, `GAMESCOPE_VRR_FEEDBACK=1`, `GAMESCOPE_DISPLAY_REFRESH_RATE_FEEDBACK=120` |
| 3 | Lone HDR stream not double-composited | UNTESTED with an HDR stream (8 was never reached). SDR baseline: the stats stream read `fps=120.000000` (with a few `119.95`) over 45 s with the shell alone and with the overlay on top, never 60. Re-run with an xcb Moonlight HDR stream once 8 passes |
| 5 | Focus unrefusable + instant | PASS: 20 of 20 switches landed, 14 to 20 ms each; `GAMESCOPECTRL_BASELAYER_APPID` honoured every time |
| 6 | Overlay over a running app | PASS (scriptable half): overlay tagged in 0.5 s, the app stayed the base window, 120 fps held, focus returned to the shell on close. "Keys go to the panel" needs a person at the TV |
| 8 | Moonlight HDR via WSI | **UNTESTED**: the reading `GAMESCOPE_HDR_OUTPUT_FEEDBACK=0` with `GAMESCOPE_DISPLAY_SUPPORTS_HDR=1` was self-inflicted. An ad-hoc probe ran a bare `gamescopectl hdr_enabled` at 10:24, which on this build resets `hdr_enabled` to false; every atom read and the xcb Moonlight run came after it, and the connector (last measured in PQ/BT2020 at 10:19) was never re-read. The native-Wayland run at 10:21 could not have shown HDR either (WSI layer, see above). Re-run with the rule above: xcb Moonlight, no bare convar queries, `measure.sh` `HDR to clients` PASS first |
| 4, 7, 9 | black floor / pad / Qt usable | need a person at the TV; 9 partially yes (the Qt 6 shell maps, holds focus, presents at 120 Hz) |

The kit defects that run exposed (a Qt 5 `qml` winning the resolver, the never-created
stats FIFO, the focus-stomping relaunch loop, the `measure.sh` root and bit-depth misreads,
Moonlight on native Wayland crashing) were fixed before the next pass.

#### 2026-09-05 phase 3 (fixed kit)

Same box, rebooted into the fixed kit (the kit's own Qt 6 shell as base layer, app 9001).
Every scriptable criterion passed; **the decision rule (1 and 3) is met**, so gamescope
stays on the table for v2.

| # | Criterion | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10-bit HDR at 4K120 | PASS: colorspace `BT2020_RGB`, `HDR_OUTPUT_METADATA` blob with EOTF = PQ, mode `3840x2160 120.00`, `GAMESCOPE_HDR_OUTPUT_FEEDBACK=1` with the connector in BT2020 in the same second. Bit depth: still UNKNOWN to the kernel (debugfs has no `Current:` line, `max bpc` 16 is the requested cap); read off the TV's info panel, which is the reading of record |
| 2 | VRR engages | PASS: `VRR_ENABLED=1`, `backend_info` `VRR Active: true`, `GAMESCOPE_VRR_FEEDBACK=1`, at boot, under `measure.sh`, under the stream and after it |
| 3 | Lone HDR stream not double-composited | PASS: with a 4K120 HEVC Main10 HDR Moonlight stream as the base layer the stats FIFO read `fps=120.000000` (a few `119.95`) for 30 s with `focus=9003`; with the SDR shell over the running stream, 120 for 30 s; back to the stream, 120 for 10 s. Never 60, never a doubled frame time. Judder remains a person-at-the-TV call |
| 5 | Focus unrefusable + instant | PASS: 5 cycles x 4 switches, 20 of 20 landed, 14 to 19 ms each, no supervisor interference |
| 6 | Overlay over a running app | PASS (scriptable half): overlay tagged in 0.5 s, `GAMESCOPE_FOCUSED_APP` empty while it owns input, base layer untouched, 120 fps held, focus back to the shell on close |
| 8 | Moonlight HDR via WSI | PASS: stream `3840x2160x120` HEVC Main10 (`hdrMode=1`), VAAPI on x11, Mailbox present; the WSI layer on the stream window logged `server hdr output enabled: true` / `hdr formats exposed to client: true`, the swapchain was recreated as `VK_FORMAT_A2B10G10R10_UNORM_PACK32` with `VK_COLOR_SPACE_HDR10_ST2084_EXT`, and `VkHdrMetadataEXT` carried BT.2020 primaries with a 1670-nit mastering peak. No `GAMESCOPE_WSI_FORCE_BYPASS` needed. Shown as base layer (`FOCUSED_APP=9003`) once the stream window was tagged |
| 4, 7, 9 | black floor / pad / Qt usable | need a person at the TV; 9 partially yes (the Qt 6 shell maps, holds focus, presents at 120 Hz) |

One thing to know for the week: an **HDMI hotplug** (the AVR/TV re-negotiating, seen
once, one second long, coinciding with a Moonlight launch) makes gamescope drop and
re-select the connector, and for that second `GAMESCOPE_HDR_OUTPUT_FEEDBACK`,
`GAMESCOPE_DISPLAY_SUPPORTS_HDR` and `GAMESCOPE_VRR_FEEDBACK` all read 0. They come back
to 1 by themselves, but any client that creates its Vulkan surface inside that second
sees `server hdr output enabled: false` and gets SDR for the lifetime of that surface.
A Moonlight run that logs `false` right after a hotplug is an artifact: quit and
relaunch it.

The three kit defects that pass exposed were: the stream window never tagged (it is not
the window named "Moonlight"), `moonlight stream` hanging on the host's "quit the running
app?" dialog, and the leading space in Sunshine's app names. All three are fixed above,
and the fixes were re-run on the same box with no manual step: `launch.sh moonlight
stream …` tagged the stream window 0x800031 at t+3 s, `GAMESCOPE_FOCUSABLE_APPS` read
`9003, 9001` and `GAMESCOPE_FOCUSED_APP` 9003 at t+6 s, the TV switched by itself, the WSI
signature and the HDR10 swapchain were as above, 120 fps held as base layer and with the
shell over it; the busy-host refusal exited 3 within a second naming the running app; and
`launch.sh apps` showed the leading space in the quoted names.

## Known gaps, on purpose

- The prototype shell launches nothing. Everything is driven from SSH, because the point
  is to measure the compositor, not to port the shell.
- The input daemon's Hyprland actor finds no compositor and logs that it is deaf on
  every retry. Expected in this session.
- `--steam` puts gamescope in the SteamControlled focus strategy so the
  `GAMESCOPECTRL_BASELAYER_*` atoms work. That strategy only considers X11 windows with a
  game id (or Steam / a Remote Play client). Wayland-native clients (Moonlight with
  `--wayland`, a Quickshell `FloatingWindow`) get an app id from their cgroup only, so they
  cannot be selected with `focus.sh`. That is one of the findings, not a bug in the kit.
- Quickshell's `PanelWindow` is a layer-shell surface; gamescope maps every layer surface
  to a non-interactive overlay. The real shell cannot run here unchanged.
- The negotiated output bit depth is not readable on every kernel (see above). `measure.sh`
  reports what it can (debugfs Maximum, the `max bpc` cap) and says UNKNOWN rather than
  guessing; the TV's info panel is the reading of record there.
- HDR reaching clients depends on `GAMESCOPE_HDR_OUTPUT_FEEDBACK`, which gamescope owns
  (`hdr_enabled` && EDID HDR10). The kit reports it and never touches convars; a bare
  `gamescopectl <convar>` from any other tool resets that convar (see the rule above), and
  `gamescopectl hdr_enabled 1` is the recovery.
- Native-Wayland clients never get HDR under gamescope (the WSI layer hardcodes it off for
  Wayland surfaces, on 3.16.23 and on master). xcb is the only HDR path for Moonlight.
- The `qml` runtime must be Qt 6. A Qt 5 `qml` on `PATH` is skipped, and if no Qt 6 one
  is found `client.sh` logs what it tried and exits, leaving gamescope up with nothing to
  present.
