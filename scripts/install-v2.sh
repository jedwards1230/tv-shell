# Install the tv-shell **v2** (gamescope) session BESIDE an existing v1 install:
# build tv-shell-core, lay a v2-only prefix, install the three v2 systemd --user
# units with their prefix token substituted, and register a v2 session entry the
# display manager can offer next to v1's.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE SCRIPT AND NOT A `--v2` MODE IN scripts/install.sh
#
#   docs/V2_DESIGN.md §11's governing rule is "beside, not instead, at every
#   shared layer", and the installer is a shared layer. A `--v2` flag would put
#   both prefixes, both unit sets and both session files behind one entry point
#   whose DEFAULT is v1 — so a forgotten flag installs over the running
#   appliance, and every step inside would need a branch to stay out of v1's way.
#   This script cannot make that mistake: it has no v1 prefix, no v1 unit name
#   and no v1 session file anywhere in it, and it refuses outright to install to
#   v1's prefix (see PREFIX validation below). The blast radius is a property of
#   the file, not of an argument.
#
#   It is also not much shared code: install.sh's bulk is v1-specific — the
#   Quickshell config symlinks, the game-shell legacy compat symlinks and
#   .desktop, the panel and daemon binaries, targets.json. v2 has none of those,
#   and has one thing v1 does not (the @TV_SHELL_V2_PREFIX@ token substitution).
#
# SESSION FILE OWNERSHIP — WHO WRITES /usr/share/wayland-sessions/tv-shell-v2.desktop
#
#   By default THIS SCRIPT writes it, so a standalone (non-Ansible) install is
#   selectable at the display manager straight after running, with no second
#   tool required.
#
#   On an Ansible-managed host it is invoked with `--no-session` and ANSIBLE owns
#   that path. Decided deliberately, because two writers of one file is a config
#   that flip-flops per run:
#
#     1. Precedent on this box: the gamescope prototype's .desktop is written by
#        homelab-ansible's roles/htpc_common/tasks/gamescope-prototype.yaml, and
#        that is the session htpc-1 boots today. One mental model for "who writes
#        wayland-sessions entries here".
#     2. ONLY Ansible can produce the full Exec. The role renders a session env
#        list into `Exec=` as a `/usr/bin/env` prefix, which is the only way to
#        set environment for a greeter-launched or autologin session — there is
#        no shell in between. The file this script writes cannot carry that, so
#        it is strictly less capable on a managed host.
#     3. Ansible gives a real off switch: its toggle REMOVES the entry. A file
#        written here would survive that toggle and leave a selectable session
#        pointing at a tree someone believed they had disabled.
#     4. Standing rule for this host: host configuration goes through Ansible,
#        not hand-install.
#
#   `--no-session` SUPPRESSES the write; it does not redirect it. `--session-dir`
#   redirects, which is a different thing and does not solve two writers.
#
# It does NOT install system dependencies (gamescope, Rust, an X server) — see
# docs/INSTALL.md and scripts/install-deps.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./scripts/install-v2.sh [--prefix DIR] [--user NAME] [options]
#
#   --prefix DIR        v2 install root (default: /opt/tv-shell-v2). MUST NOT be
#                       v1's /opt/tv-shell, or anywhere under it — the script
#                       normalises the path and refuses. Relative paths are made
#                       absolute (the units need an absolute ExecStart).
#   --user NAME         User whose ~/.config gets the units and core.toml, and
#                       who owns the prefix (default: $SUDO_USER, else invoker).
#   --session-dir DIR   Where to write the session .desktop
#                       (default: /usr/share/wayland-sessions).
#   --session-exec CMD  Exec= for the session .desktop
#                       (default: <prefix>/bin/tv-shell-gamescope-session.sh).
#   --unit-dir DIR      systemd --user unit dir
#                       (default: <home>/.config/systemd/user).
#   --config-dir DIR    Per-user config dir (default: <home>/.config/tv-shell).
#   --no-build          Skip building tv-shell-core (reuse an existing binary).
#   --no-session        Do not write (or create the dir for) the session
#                       .desktop. Use on an Ansible-managed host, where Ansible
#                       owns that file — see SESSION FILE OWNERSHIP above.
#   -h, --help          Show this help.
