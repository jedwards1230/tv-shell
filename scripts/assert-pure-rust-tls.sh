#
# WHAT "PURE RUST" MEANS HERE — read this before trusting the filename
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every TLS user in this workspace is meant to resolve to **rustls with the
# `ring` provider**.
#
# `ring` is NOT literally pure Rust: it ships some C and pre-generated assembly
# compiled through `cc`. So the honest invariant is narrower than the script's
# name suggests, and worth stating precisely rather than leaving a comment that
# the next person discovers is false:
#
#   * no cmake
#   * no system TLS library (no OpenSSL, no platform TLS stack as the provider)
#   * no build-time dependency beyond the C toolchain every target already has
#
# `aws-lc-rs` — rustls' other provider — is strictly worse on exactly that axis:
# it wants cmake and a fuller C build environment. That is the whole reason the
# feature selection exists, and what this gate protects.
#
# The practical payoff: `host/` cross-compiles clean for Windows and macOS, and
# the daemon's default build pulls in no system C *libraries*.
#
# Nothing enforced it. `host.yml` runs fmt/clippy/build/test and no dependency
# check at all; the only `ldd` assertion lives in `rust.yml`, applies to the
# daemon binary alone, and greps specifically for `libcec|libp8-platform` — it
# would sail straight past a crypto-provider regression.
#
# The invariant is one careless default-feature away at all times. rumqttc is
# the live example: its DEFAULT feature enables `tokio-rustls/default`, whose
# provider is `aws-lc-rs` (cmake + a C toolchain). It is pulled in only via
# `default-features = false, features = ["use-rustls-no-provider"]` plus a
# direct `rustls` pinned to `ring`. A single `cargo update`, a transitive
# default-feature change, or one future contributor adding a TLS dependency
# re-introduces it silently — and the first symptom is a broken Windows build,
# far from the cause.
#
# SCOPE — read this before assuming it checks more than it does.
# This asserts the TLS/crypto provider only. The sibling invariant — that no C
# toolchain or system C library enters a build at all — is a different question
# with a different remediation, and lives in scripts/assert-no-system-c.sh,
# which shares this script's `cargo tree --invert` mechanism and nothing else.
# It says nothing about the daemon's
# `cec` feature, which deliberately static-links libcec and needs libudev; that
# has its own `ldd` gate in `rust.yml`.
#
# NOT BANNED, on purpose: `schannel` (Windows) and `security-framework` (macOS)
# are platform trust-store bindings that `rustls-native-certs` legitimately
# uses. They bind OS system libraries that are always present and need no build
# toolchain, so they do not threaten the cross-compile the way `aws-lc-rs` does.

A cmake/system-TLS crypto crate reached the dependency graph.

This breaks the invariant that lets host/ cross-compile for Windows and macOS
without cmake or a system TLS library. The usual cause is a dependency pulling
rustls through its DEFAULT features, which select the aws-lc-rs provider.

Fix it at the dependency, not here — for example:

  somecrate = { version = "x", default-features = false, features = ["use-rustls-no-provider"] }
  rustls    = { version = "0.23", default-features = false, features = ["ring", "std", "tls12", "logging"] }

Then re-run:  scripts/assert-pure-rust-tls.sh --workspace
EOF
  exit 1
fi

echo "OK: TLS/crypto graph resolves to rustls + ring (no cmake, no system TLS)."
