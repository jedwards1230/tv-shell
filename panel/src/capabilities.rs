//! The capability snapshot the panel resolves **once at startup**, and the
//! [`Gate`] vocabulary that both route registration (`crate::build_router`)
//! and the nav (`templates/base.html`) are driven from.
//!
//! ## Capability is declared by the node, never inferred
//!
//! `docs/MULTI_NODE_PANEL.md` §1. The node answers a `capabilities` handshake
//! naming what it can serve; the panel registers exactly the surfaces that set
//! supports and nothing else. **Gating is on the route, not just the nav** — a
//! hidden link in front of a live handler is not a gate, so a gated-off route
//! is simply never registered and answers **404 (it does not exist)** rather
//! than a 403 from a handler. That also leaks nothing about the node.
//!
//! ## Four tiers
//!
//! 1. **Recovery** ([`Gate::Recovery`]) — always registered, gated on nothing.
//!    These do not need the daemon: they are the panel's own exec tier
//!    (`systemctl`/`journalctl`/`ps`/`pacman`), its own filesystem work, or
//!    static assets. *This is the panel's reason to exist*, so a failed
//!    handshake must never take one away.
//! 2. **Node** ([`Gate::Node`]) — registered iff the handshake SUCCEEDED.
//!    Routes that need *some* node speaking the IPC line protocol but map to
//!    no single [`Feature`]: the network/bluetooth, navigation, launcher and
//!    power-probe commands, and the raw console page. The honest statement is
//!    "these exist iff a node answered".
//! 3. **Capability** (every other [`Gate`]) — registered iff a specific
//!    [`Feature`] is in the declared set.
//! 4. **Danger** — `[panel].allow_dangerous`, unchanged, and **intersected**
//!    with a capability gate where a route is both (`/dev/deploy`,
//!    `/dev/build` need `allow_dangerous` AND [`Feature::DevDeploy`]).
//!
//! ## Registration is static, so a capability change needs a panel restart
//!
//! The snapshot is taken before the router is built and never re-taken. That is
//! sound because the node's set is itself static: `daemon/src/ipc.rs::features()`
//! derives it from compile-time cfgs (cargo features, `target_os`) plus startup
//! config (`[http]`/`[mcp]` binds), and health is deliberately **not** in it — a
//! wedged CEC adapter does not drop `cec`. So a capability change already
//! implies a new binary or a config edit plus a daemon restart; nothing
//! transient can flip it under a running panel.
//!
//! ## A failed handshake falls back to recovery-only, never to "everything"
//!
//! [`CapabilitySnapshot::unreachable`] is an EMPTY feature set with
//! `handshake_ok = false`, so only the recovery tier registers. Fail-closed and
//! daemon-independent are the same set here, which is the whole point: with the
//! daemon down the panel keeps precisely the surface that still works, and
//! gains nothing that would lie. Registering everything on a failed handshake
//! would defeat the gate entirely.
