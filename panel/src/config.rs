//! Panel configuration: reads the daemon's `~/.config/tv-shell/config.toml`
//! for the `[panel]`, `[http]` and `[dev]` sections only.
//!
//! The panel cannot depend on the `tv-shell-input` daemon crate (it pulls a
//! Linux-only evdev/zbus/bluer/cec graph), so it parses the shared
//! `config.toml` itself with a PERMISSIVE deserializer: only the sections it
//! needs are declared, every other section (`[mcp]`, `[cec]`, `[plex]`,
//! `[steam]`, `[observability]`, `[input]`, ...) is silently ignored by
//! serde's default "unknown fields are OK" behavior (no `deny_unknown_fields`
//! anywhere in this module).
//!
//! ```toml
//! [panel]
//! enabled = true
//! bind = "127.0.0.1:8091"
//! token_file = "~/.config/tv-shell/panel-token"  # 0600; enables panel auth
//! allow_dangerous = false                        # deploy/build/reboot/pacman
//!
//! [http]
//! bind = "127.0.0.1:8089"
//! token_file = "~/.config/tv-shell/http-token"
//!
//! [dev]
//! allow_insecure_lan = false  # shared with the daemon — one flag to audit
//! ```
//!
//! Parsing never panics and never blocks boot: a missing file yields all
//! defaults and a malformed file logs a warning and falls back to defaults —
//! the panel must always come up so an operator can reach the Dev recovery
//! page even when config.toml is broken.
//!
//! **Resolution, however, can refuse to start** (mirroring the daemon's
//! `DaemonConfig::validate`): a `[panel].token_file` that escapes the config
//! dir, is group/other-accessible, or is unreadable aborts startup rather than
//! silently degrading to "no auth", and a non-loopback `[panel].bind` with
//! auth effectively disabled aborts unless `[dev].allow_insecure_lan = true`.
