//! [`HttpTransport`] — the bearer-auth HTTP [`NodeTransport`] implementation,
//! and the panel's data tier for a **sidecar** node.
//!
//! `docs/MULTI_NODE_PANEL.md` §4: a shell node runs the panel locally (its
//! recovery tier is inherently local — you cannot `systemctl restart` a wedged
//! unit from another box). A **sidecar** node has no local tier worth
//! recovering, so it is served **remotely** by a Linux-built panel over HTTP.
//! That is what this module is for, and it is why no Windows panel build is on
//! the path.
//!
//! Wire protocol (authoritative: `host/src/main.rs`): seven routes, all but
//! `/art/{appid}` behind `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, all answering JSON.
//!
//! | Command line | Request |
//! |---|---|
//! | `capabilities` | `GET /capabilities` |
//! | `library` | `GET /library` |
//! | `status` | `GET /status` |
//! | `open-bpm` | `POST /open-bpm` (no body) |
//! | `sleep` | `POST /sleep` (no body) |
//! | `launch <appid>` | `POST /launch` `{"appid":<u32>}` |
//! | `quit <appid>` | `POST /quit` `{"appid":<u32>}` |
//!
//! ## Why these line names and not the daemon's `steam-*` ones
//!
//! The daemon exposes a *proxy* vocabulary for the same sidecar —
//! `steam-library`, `steam-launch <appid>`, `steam-quit <appid>`,
//! `steam-bigpicture`, `steam-suspend` (`docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md`). Reusing those
//! names here would be a lie about the reply: `steam-library` answers a
//! daemon-shaped envelope (`{"status":…,"recentlyPlayed":[…],"allGames":[…],
//! "host":…}`) built by `daemon/src/steam.rs`, while `GET /library` answers the
//! sidecar's own `LibraryResponse` (`{"games":[…]}`). One name, two shapes, and
//! a caller that parsed one would silently mis-parse the other.
//!
//! Re-deriving the daemon's envelope in the panel is the other way to make the
//! names honest, and it is worse: it duplicates health-status and active-host
//! logic that is the daemon's, in a crate that cannot depend on the daemon.
//!
//! So this transport speaks the **sidecar's own vocabulary, named after its own
//! routes**, and [`NodeTransport::command`]'s docs now say plainly that the
//! trait fixes the shape of a command and not the vocabulary. See that method
//! for why the split is the capability split rather than an abstraction leak
//! worth closing.
//!
//! ## Not gated on `cfg(unix)`
//!
//! Unlike [`crate::ipc`], nothing here is Unix-specific — `reqwest` builds
//! everywhere. The panel crate as a whole still does not build on Windows (see
//! `docs/MULTI_NODE_PANEL.md` §2's blocker list), and this module does not
//! change that; it removes the *reason* to want it to.
