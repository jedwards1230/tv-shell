//! `NodeTransport` — the seam between the panel's pages and whatever speaks
//! for a node.
//!
//! The panel used to hold a concrete `IpcClient` and every page called it
//! directly. That hard-wires "a node" to "a Unix socket on this machine",
//! which is exactly the assumption `docs/MULTI_NODE_PANEL.md` needs to break:
//! a remote node is reached over HTTP, not over `AF_UNIX`. This module names
//! the thing the pages actually depend on — *send a command line to a node and
//! get its reply* — so a second implementation can be dropped in without
//! touching a handler.
//!
//! ## Why the trait is split in two
//!
//! [`AppState`](crate::state::AppState) holds `Arc<dyn NodeTransport>`, so the
//! base trait must stay **object-safe**: no generic methods. The generic and
//! derived helpers (`command_json::<T>`, `get_config`, `set_config`) therefore
//! live on [`NodeTransportExt`], which is blanket-implemented for every
//! `NodeTransport` (including `dyn NodeTransport`) and defined **purely in
//! terms of [`NodeTransport::command`]** — so an implementation cannot make
//! them behave differently, and their behavior is unchanged by construction.
//!
//! ## Why the command is a `&str`, not a typed `Command` enum
//!
//! The multi-node spec sketches `command(&self, cmd: &Command) -> Response`.
//! No such wire vocabulary exists to reuse: the daemon's `Command` enum is
//! private to `daemon/src/protocol.rs` and nothing in `protocol/` (the
//! cross-crate contract) models a command. Inventing one here would be a new
//! surface — and would rewrite the error handling at every call site — rather
//! than a refactor. The panel keeps speaking the line-based protocol it
//! already speaks (`docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md`).
