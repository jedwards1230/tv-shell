//! `/system/services` — the systemd unit table, its per-unit restart, and the
//! arbitrary-unit inspector.
//!
//! Split out of the old Processes page (`docs/PANEL_IA.md` phase 2): unit
//! *control* is a different job from process *observation*, and it is the one
//! surface on the page that mutates anything. Phase 5 (#409) added the
//! read/restart asymmetry this page exists for:
//!
//! * **Read: any unit**, system or user, including one typed into the inspect
//!   form. Reading unit status is inert, so this side is unrestricted — but
//!   the typed name still goes through [`config::UnitName::parse`] before it
//!   reaches a `systemctl` argv, and only ever reaches `systemctl show`.
//! * **Restart: an allowlist only** — the three built-in tv-shell units plus
//!   whatever `[panel].managed_units` names. The client sends a *key*; the
//!   unit name is resolved server-side out of [`config::AppConfig`]. An
//!   arbitrary client-supplied unit name never reaches a mutating `systemctl`
//!   on any path, and cannot: [`crate::exec::Recovery::restart`] takes a
//!   [`config::RestartTarget`], which only the server-side table constructs.
//!
//! Degradation: everything here is exec-based (`systemctl`), so it works with
//! the daemon down. That is the whole point — this is a recovery surface.
//! System-scope restarts additionally need a per-unit NOPASSWD sudoers line
//! (`docs/PANEL.md` § Deployment prerequisite); with none, the restart fails
//! **closed** with an explicit refusal naming the unit, never a silent no-op.
