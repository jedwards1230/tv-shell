# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A 10-foot couch gaming UI built with [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org/) (QML) on Hyprland. Controller-navigable home screen for Moonlight game streaming, local app launching, and system settings. Designed for 4K@120Hz HDR on OLED displays.

## Architecture

```
SDDM → game-shell-session.sh → Hyprland (kiosk) → Quickshell (shell.qml)
       │                                  │  ▲ intent:* control-surface stream + Keys
       │  Super* → super-intent.sh ───────┼──┘ (keyboard → intents: menu/home/reset)
                               └── game-shell-input (Rust daemon: EVIOCGRAB the
                                   gamepad fleet → per-player uinput; backend IPC)
```

- **shell.qml** — entry point: state machine (`idle` → `launching` → `streaming` → `reconnecting`) and process management
- **game-shell-input** (Rust daemon, `daemon/`) — the sole backend. It owns the **gamepad fleet only**: grabs every connected pad exclusively via evdev (`EVIOCGRAB`, tracked by fd with a DB-match-or-reject discovery gate), manages hot-join/leave with stable per-player slots (#98), and re-presents each pad as a clean per-player virtual gamepad in the game presenter. It emits nav keys + a first-class **`intent` control surface** (`intent <name>` command → `intent:*` broadcast — the closed vocabulary keyboard-escape and automation also ride), plus fleet outputs (rumble/battery/LED, #99/#100/#101), and serves the full Unix-socket IPC (settings, app discovery, Bluetooth/network/power, Hyprland reads, Sunshine). **It does NOT read the keyboard** — the keyboard (K400) belongs to the compositor + QML (Wayland focus / `Keys`); Hyprland binds inject intents via `scripts/super-intent.sh`: bare **`Super` → `intent menu`** (toggle the nav drawer), **`Super+Escape` → `intent home`** (return-to-shell escape), **`Super+Backspace` → `intent home-hold`** (reset). Build with `cargo build --release` and install to `$SHELL_DIR/bin/game-shell-input`; the session script spawns it directly
- **Theme.qml** — singleton (must be `Item`, not `QtObject` — Quickshell can't host Process/Timer children in QtObject) with all colors, fonts, and layout constants. Dark/light/auto mode state is read from `SettingsStore`
- **SettingsStore.qml** — singleton (also `Item`, for the same reason) that owns all QML-side settings I/O for `~/.config/game-shell/settings.json` and the binding IPC (get/set/capture). Single source of truth for the settings schema
- **components/qmldir** — component registry. New components must be added here or Quickshell won't find them

## Key Data Flows

- **Streaming targets**: Loaded from `/opt/game-shell/targets.json` at startup (single-line JSON — see gotchas). Managed in-UI via MoonlightSettings. Optional `sunshineUser`/`sunshinePass`/`sunshinePort` fields enable pre-flight session detection via the Sunshine API — when present, the shell checks for active sessions before streaming and offers Resume/Quit/Cancel if a different app is running. Credentials should be injected by the deployment system, not committed.
- **Settings persistence**: `~/.config/game-shell/settings.json` stores `themeMode`, `streamingViewMode`, `controllerDebug` (QML-owned) and `keyBindings` (daemon-owned). The **daemon is the sole writer** — `SettingsStore` reads via `get-config` and hands QML-owned keys to `set-config` (read-modify-write), so QML never formats config JSON itself. All QML-side I/O is centralized in the `SettingsStore` singleton — add new settings there (a property + load/save handling), not in Theme.qml. Theme delegates to SettingsStore.
- **App discovery & recents**: `AppDiscoveryManager` (apps via `list-apps`) and `RecentsTracker` (`get-recents` / `record-launch`) read JSON straight from the daemon, which owns the `.desktop` scanning (`freedesktop-desktop-entry` crate) and recents file. QML no longer parses `.desktop` files. The QML side talks to the daemon over a native `Quickshell.Io` socket via `SocketClient.qml` (#97) — the old per-call `python3 -c` Unix-socket shims were retired.
- **Input daemon IPC**: See [docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md](docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md) for the full protocol specification. QML sends commands via Unix socket; the daemon streams events to subscribers.
- **Settings panels**: SettingsPanel uses a Loader to swap between section components. Each section manages its own system calls via `Quickshell.Io.Process`.

## System Integration

| Tool | Used For |
|------|----------|
| input daemon (IPC) | Gamepad grab/release, settings I/O (`get/set-config`), app discovery (`list-apps`), recents (`get/record`), Bluetooth (`bt-*`), network reads (`net-*`), suspend/battery (`power-*`), Hyprland reads (`hypr-active`/`hypr-clients` + `hypr:*` events), Sunshine pre-flight (`sunshine-status`) — see [docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md](docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md) |
| `wpctl` | Audio volume/mute/sink switching (WirePlumber/PipeWire) |
| `nmcli` | WiFi *join* only (`device wifi connect`) — reads go through the daemon's `net-*` IPC |
| `hyprctl` | Monitor mode/scale changes, app launching, reload, one-shot `dispatch` actions — window/client *reads* go through the daemon's `hypr-*` IPC |
| `systemctl` | Reboot/poweroff one-shots — suspend goes through the daemon's `power-suspend` IPC |
| `cec-client` | _retired_ — HDMI-CEC now owned by the daemon's `cec-*` IPC (`cec-rs`/libcec, #94); built only `--features cec`. The `cec-client`/`cec-ctl`/`living-room-cec` QML fallback chain is removed |
| `moonlight` | Game streaming client (`stream`, `list`, `pair`) |

The daemon's `bt-*` (BlueZ/`bluer`), `net-*` (NetworkManager/`zbus`, read-only),
and `power-*` (logind + UPower/`zbus`) IPC commands are the **D-Bus backbone**
(Phase 3, #28). **Phase 4** adds Hyprland reads (`hypr-active`/`hypr-clients` +
`hypr:activewindow`/`hypr:fullscreen` events via direct Hyprland IPC sockets,
replacing the `hyprctl clients -j` shell-out and feeding `AppLifecycleManager.qml`) and
Sunshine session detection (`sunshine-status <host> <port>` via `reqwest`/rustls
against Sunshine's self-signed `/serverinfo`, replacing the inline HTTP polls in
`StreamManager.qml`/`StreamCard.qml`). These replace the
QML shell-outs/HTTP polls that *read* system state. The Linux-only modules
(D-Bus, Hyprland) are unverifiable on macOS/CI and need on-device verification on
game-client-1; `sunshine-status` runs cross-platform but its live fetch needs a
reachable host (its response parser is pure and unit-tested). What deliberately
stays a shell-out: Wi-Fi **join** (`nmcli`), audio (`wpctl`), one-shot compositor
*actions* (`hyprctl dispatch`), and reboot/poweroff (`systemctl`). **HDMI-CEC**
moved into the daemon (`cec-*` IPC via `cec-rs`/libcec, #94/#16): a single
persistent in-process libcec connection replaces the per-call shell-outs. It is
**feature-gated** (`cargo build --features cec`) and Linux-only so the default
build keeps the no-system-C-deps invariant — the libcec-sys C link is exercised
only in the dedicated `--features cec` CI leg and on game-client-1 (libcec 7).

## Development

No build step — QML is interpreted by Quickshell at runtime. Deploy by syncing files to the target machine's install directory and restarting Quickshell.

### Deploy Cycle

```bash
# 1. Push changes to git
git push origin <branch>

# 2. Pull on target device
ssh <device> "cd /opt/game-shell && git pull"

# 3. Restart Quickshell (find Hyprland signature first)
SIG=$(ls /run/user/1000/hypr/ | tail -1)
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000 \
  HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE=$SIG hyprctl dispatch exec 'killall quickshell'
sleep 1
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000 \
  HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE=$SIG quickshell -c game-shell &

# 4. Screenshot for verification
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000 grim /tmp/screenshot.png
```

### Rust Input Daemon

```bash
cd daemon && cargo build --release
install -m755 target/release/game-shell-input /opt/game-shell/bin/game-shell-input
```

**HDMI-CEC is an opt-in feature (#94).** A plain `cargo build` is C-free; the
`cec` feature pulls in `cec-rs`/`libcec-sys`, which links the libcec C library
(needs `libcec-dev`, `libp8-platform-dev`, `libudev-dev`, `libclang-dev` at
build time). Build it only on a host with those present (game-client-1 / Fedora
43 ships libcec 7; the deploy build uses `--features cec`):

```bash
cd daemon && cargo build --release --features cec
```

Requires Linux with evdev and uinput access. Auto-discovers gamepad by vendor/product ID (defaults: Xbox controller `045e:028e`, configurable via `GAMEPAD_VENDOR`/`GAMEPAD_PRODUCT` env vars). The Linux-only evdev/uinput/D-Bus modules build only on the target (or CI); the cross-platform subset (`protocol`, `config`, `state`, `device` GUID math, `apps`, `health`, `recents`) builds and tests on any host.

## Design Constraints

- **10-foot UI at 4K**: All font sizes and layout constants in Theme.qml are sized for couch-distance reading. Don't shrink them.
- **Controller-first navigation**: Every interactive element must be reachable via D-pad (arrow keys) and activatable with A (Enter). B (Escape) always goes back. Focus management is critical — use `KeyNavigation` chains and `Keys.on*Pressed` handlers.
- **Palette rules**: See `config/palette.md`. Never use gold for text. Crimson for focus/active states. Ember for secondary interactive elements. All overlay backdrops use `Qt.rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7-0.85)`.
- **No build tooling**: No bundler, no compiler, no package manager for QML. Files are deployed as-is.
- **Distribution agnostic**: This repo has no knowledge of specific infrastructure, deployment tools, or host management. It's a standalone QML shell that runs on any Linux system with Hyprland + Quickshell.

## Gotchas

- **SplitParser reads line-by-line**: Any JSON loaded via `cat` + `SplitParser` must be single-line. Never pretty-print `targets.json` or `settings.json`.
- **Theme.qml is an Item, not QtObject**: Quickshell 0.3.0 can't host Process/Timer children inside QtObject. The singleton uses Item as its root type.
- **`image://icon/` for Freedesktop icons**: Use `Image { source: "image://icon/" + iconName }` to load icons from the system theme. Falls back to nothing if the icon doesn't exist — provide a letter-initial fallback.
- **qmldir must list new components**: Quickshell won't auto-discover them. Add a line like `MyComponent 1.0 MyComponent.qml`.
- **WAYLAND_DISPLAY may vary**: Usually `wayland-1` but try `wayland-0` if grim/hyprctl fails.
- **Hyprland instance signature**: Multiple instances may exist in `/run/user/1000/hypr/`; use `tail -1` for the latest.
- **Theme property renames cascade**: `Theme.text` → `Theme.textPrimary` will also hit `Theme.textDim` producing `Theme.textPrimaryDim`. Replace longest matches first.

## CI

- **QML formatting**: `qmlformat` (Qt 6.8) enforced via GitHub Actions. On PRs, unformatted files are auto-fixed and pushed. On main, unformatted files fail the check.
