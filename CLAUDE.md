This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A 10-foot couch gaming UI built with [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org/) (QML) on Hyprland. Controller-navigable home screen for Moonlight game streaming, local app launching, and system settings. Designed for 4K@120Hz HDR on OLED displays.

## Architecture

```
SDDM → tv-shell-session.sh → Hyprland (kiosk) → Quickshell (shell.qml)
       │                                  │  ▲ intent:* control-surface stream + Keys
       │  Super* → super-intent.sh ───────┼──┘ (keyboard → intents: menu/home/reset)
                               └── tv-shell-input (Rust daemon: EVIOCGRAB the
                                   gamepad fleet → per-player uinput; backend IPC)
```

- **shell.qml** — entry point: state machine (`idle` → `launching` → `streaming` → `reconnecting`) and process management. Quickshell runs as the `tv-shell-quickshell.service` `systemd --user` unit (started by Hyprland `exec-once`, direct-spawn fallback) — a single-instance guarantee + restart-on-crash that kills the "stacked duplicate Quickshell instances" bug class (#254). See [docs/SYSTEMD_SETUP.md](docs/SYSTEMD_SETUP.md)
- **tv-shell-input** (Rust daemon, `daemon/`) — the sole backend. It owns the **gamepad fleet only**: grabs every connected pad exclusively via evdev (`EVIOCGRAB`, tracked by fd with a DB-match-or-reject discovery gate), manages hot-join/leave with stable per-player slots, and re-presents each pad as a clean per-player virtual gamepad in the game presenter. It emits nav keys + a first-class **`intent` control surface** (`intent <name>` command → `intent:*` broadcast — the closed vocabulary keyboard-escape and automation also ride), plus fleet outputs (rumble/battery/LED), and serves the full Unix-socket IPC (settings, app discovery, Bluetooth/network/power, Hyprland reads, Sunshine). **It does NOT read the keyboard** — the keyboard (K400) belongs to the compositor + QML (Wayland focus / `Keys`); Hyprland binds inject intents via `scripts/super-intent.sh`: bare **`Super` → `intent menu`** (toggle the nav drawer), **`Super+Escape` → `intent home`** (return-to-shell escape), **`Super+Backspace` → `intent home-hold`** (reset), **`Super+Right` → `intent overlay:session`** (open Session QAM). Build with `scripts/build-daemon.sh` (canonical; uses `--features cec,mcp`) or `cargo build --release --features cec,mcp` and install to `$TV_SHELL_DIR/bin/tv-shell-input`; the session script starts it as the `tv-shell-input.service` `systemd --user` unit (bare-process fallback when no user manager / under a `TV_SHELL_INPUT_BIN` dev override) — see [docs/SYSTEMD_SETUP.md](docs/SYSTEMD_SETUP.md)
- **tv-shell-panel** (Rust binary, `panel/`) — a LAN-only web control panel (axum + askama + htmx) that runs as its own `tv-shell-panel.service` `systemd --user` unit beside the daemon, giving an operator a browser-based recovery path even when the daemon is wedged. Since the IA refresh it is a left drawer of six groups — Overview, System, Shell, Devices, Remote, Dev — over 18 pages; the Settings, Media and Tools pages were dissolved into those groups and their old paths redirect (docs/PANEL_IA.md). It layers three data tiers — Unix-socket IPC, the daemon's HTTP bridge, and direct `systemctl`/`journalctl` exec — over the same control surface the daemon exposes. See [docs/PANEL.md](docs/PANEL.md).
- **tv-shell-core** (Rust binary, `core/`) — the **v2** core, built BESIDE the v1 daemon and never instead of it: gamescope base-layer policy (one `GAMESCOPECTRL_BASELAYER_APPID` write plus one bounded verify), scope launching via `systemd-run --user --scope`, and the `ScreenState` read that replaces the v1 `hypr-*` queries. It has its own config file (`core.toml`), socket, units and install prefix, because v1's `config.toml` root is `deny_unknown_fields` and must keep booting on the couch untouched. Nothing here is wired into the v1 session. See [docs/V2_DESIGN.md](docs/V2_DESIGN.md) and [core/README.md](core/README.md).
- **tv-shell-v2** (Qt Quick app, `shell-v2/`) — the **v2** shell, built BESIDE v1's `shell/` and never instead of it, exactly as `core/` sits beside `daemon/`. A spike, wired into no session. Three things it establishes and every later screen follows: an X11 **pre-map tagging shim** (`Surface` declares a *role* — base / overlay / toast — and the role drives the `STEAM_*` atoms, written before the window maps, since gamescope decides at window creation); **ONE QML module** (`TvShell`, via `qt_add_qml_module` — no hand-written `qmldir`, no relative-directory imports, against v1's eleven registries and 69 such imports); and a **declarative focus graph** (a component declares *where it sits*, a router computes neighbours from the live cell set, so disabling a widget cannot strand focus). Unlike v1's `shell/` it has a **CMake build** and is **not rsync-deployable** — see the Design Constraints note and [docs/V2_SHELL.md](docs/V2_SHELL.md). Decision logic stays in pure `.pragma library` JS, the one v1 pattern carried forward deliberately.
- **ShellLayout.qml** — hosts every top-level surface (Home, Library, Settings, overlays, drawers) and owns the **ScreenManager** router. shell.qml reaches the shell only through `ShellLayout`'s API (`openSettings`/`closeSettings`, `toggleMenu`, `focusHome`, …), never into a surface's internals.
- **ScreenManager.qml** — minimal navigation model for the secondary-screen layer (Home is the base; Library/Settings open over it). `push("settings", {page})` / `push("library")` / `popToHome()` centralize the imperative show/hide + focus handoff. It does NOT own modal/overlay back-handling or the Settings-internal B-stack — it reacts to each surface's `closed` signal and never intercepts Escape. Visibility/focus **bindings** stay declarative on the surfaces.
- **settings/SettingsApp.qml** — the Settings "app": its own `shell.settings` module (the 12 sidebar pages + sidebar). Public API `open()` / `openPage(id)` / `close()` + `closed` signal. The `widgets`/`moonlight`/`streaming` deep-links are intercepted earlier in `ShellLayout.openSettings` (they route to the Widgets app), so they never reach SettingsApp.
- **widgets/WidgetsApp.qml** — the Widgets "app", mirroring SettingsApp: its own `shell.widgets` module with the same public-API shape (`open()` / `openPage(id)` deep-links into a widget's config, e.g. `"moonlight"` / `close()` + `closed` signal) that `ShellLayout`/`ScreenManager` drive — callers never reach into its internals. It owns the back-stack between two distinct leaf views: **`WidgetList.qml`** (L0 — the widget list, order model + reorder/toggle/configure) and **`WidgetConfig.qml`** (L1 — the manifest-driven per-widget config, with the Moonlight server surface inlined). It is schema-driven from `WidgetManifests` (no per-widget page code) and replaced the old monolithic `components/WidgetsScreen.qml`.
- **Theme.qml** — singleton (must be `Item`, not `QtObject` — Quickshell can't host Process/Timer children in QtObject) with all colors, fonts, and layout constants. Dark/light/auto mode state is read from `SettingsStore`
- **SettingsStore.qml** — singleton (also `Item`, for the same reason) that owns all QML-side settings I/O for `~/.config/tv-shell/settings.json` and the binding IPC (get/set/capture). Single source of truth for the settings schema
- **components/qmldir** — component registry. New components must be added here or Quickshell won't find them

### Shared Component Library (`lib/`)

Reusable, page-agnostic UI components live in **`shell/components/lib/`** — a
separate Quickshell module (`module components.lib`) with its own `qmldir`.
**Prefer extracting a shared component over copy-pasting a UI pattern.** If you
hand-roll the same structure on a second page (a dropdown, a chip selector, a
status pill, a modal/overlay shell), promote it to `lib/` instead.

Import convention (verified on-device):

- **A `lib/` component reaches parent singletons** (`Theme`, `Units`,
  `SettingsStore`) and sibling atoms (`SettingsButton`) via an **unnamed relative
  import** at the top of the file: `import "../"` — those names then resolve bare,
  exactly as in the flat `components/` module.
- **A flat `components/` file** (e.g. `HomeScreen.qml`, `NowPlayingCard.qml`,
  `MediaWidget.qml`) accesses **sibling `components` types** (`AppCard`,
  `NavigableRow`, `FocusFrame`, `MarqueeText`, …) **implicitly** — Quickshell
  resolves same-directory types, so **no import is needed** for them. Such a file
  adds **only** `import "lib"`, and that solely for the `components.lib` types it
  uses (e.g. `PointerTrackingArea`, `MprisPlayerBase`). **Never add `import "../"`
  to a flat `components/` file** — from `components/` that points at `shell/`, not
  at `components/`, so it does not provide sibling types and is used by no file here
  (verify: `grep -l 'import "\.\./"' shell/components/*.qml` returns nothing).
- **A per-widget dir** (`widgets/moonlight/`, `widgets/steamlib/`,
  `widgets/nowplaying/`, `widgets/plex/`, `widgets/apps/`, `widgets/steam/`) is two
  levels under `shell/`. Its files reach the widget framework via `import "../lib"`
  (`Widget`, `FilterChips`), the flat `components` singletons/atoms via
  `import "../../components"` (`Theme`, `Units`, `InputMode`, `NavigableRow`,
  `StreamCard`, `FocusFrame`, …), and `components.lib` types via
  `import "../../components/lib"` (`ServiceMonitor`, `ServiceStatusNotice`,
  `PointerTrackingArea`, `MprisPlayerBase`). Types in the **same** widget dir resolve
  implicitly. (`NowPlayingCard` stays in `components/`, so `nowplaying/` reaches it
  via `import "../../components"`.) `MoonlightWidget.qml` and `SteamWidget.qml` each
  reach the shared `SteamLibraryView`/`SteamCard` via `import "../steamlib"`.
- **A `lib/` file reaching a sibling `lib/` type** — a `components.lib` type or
  **singleton** in the same directory (e.g. `WidgetHost.qml` using the
  `WidgetRegistry` singleton, or any lib file using `MprisPlayerBase`) — resolves it
  **implicitly via same-directory resolution; no `import "."` is needed** (and none
  is used — `WidgetHost` references `WidgetRegistry` with no `import "."` and renders
  on-device). Singletons included: a same-directory `pragma Singleton` resolves the
  same way. `import "../"` from a `lib/` file is **only** for reaching PARENT
  (`components`) singletons, never for same-`lib` siblings.
- **A page consumes the library** with `import "lib"` — `lib/` types
  (`SettingsDropdown`, `SettingsButtonGroup`, `HintBar`, …) then resolve bare.
- Every new `lib/` type must be added to `shell/components/lib/qmldir`.

Constraints carried over from the flat module:

- Selectable/interactive `lib/` components must remain **`FocusScope`s** so
  `SettingsApp`'s outer Flickable scroll-follow (which tracks `activeFocusItem`)
  keeps working — never wrap controls in a `fillHeight` self-scrolling `ListView`.
- Pages own their `KeyNavigation` chains; a `lib/` component should expose
  `KeyNavigation.up`/`.down` (or equivalent aliases) so callers keep wiring focus.

Existing reusable atoms still in the flat `components/` dir (`BaseCard`,
`FocusFrame`, `NavigableRow`, `Drawer`, `SettingsButton`/`List`/`EmptyState`,
`DimmedBackdrop`) are migrated into `lib/` opportunistically, not all at once.

**`Widget.qml`** is the base type for home-screen widgets (Now Playing, Moonlight,
Plex, Apps). It bakes in the duck-typed focus contract HomeScreen + NavigableRow
query (`previousRow`/`nextRow`/`firstRow`/`lastRow`, `canFocus`/`regionFocused`,
`focusFirstChild()`, `widgetEnabled`, `size`, `escaped`, `ensureVisibleRequested`)
with single-stop defaults, so a widget extending it satisfies the contract for free
and overrides only what it needs. Up/Down traversal is inherited from the shared
`shell/components/lib/focusChain.js` helper (also used by `NavigableRow`/
`NavigableGrid`/`WakeCard`); `escaped` + `ensureVisibleRequested` are forwarded by
`WidgetHost` so `HomeScreen` wires them once. `MprisPlayerBase` extends it
(overriding `canFocus`/`focusFirstChild`).

**Per-widget config is namespaced (#249 Phase 3).** Each widget owns a
`widgets.<id>.{enabled,order,size,prefs}` subtree in `settings.json`, the QML SSOT
for its config. **`SettingsStore.widget(id)`** reads the (fully-defaulted) subtree;
`setWidget(id,key,value)` / `setWidgetPref(id,prefKey,value)` / `setWidgetOrder(ids)`
write it. There are NO flat `widget*` keys or `Theme.widget*` passthroughs anymore —
read config via `SettingsStore.widget(id)`. **`WidgetManifests.qml`** (singleton,
pure data) is the manifest SSOT: per-widget `id`/`name`/`version`/`requires`
(capability strings)/`config` schema (typed `bool|enum|int|string` controls, plus
the framework-owned `size` enum). **`widgetConfig.js`** (`.pragma library`, pure) is
the one-shot migrator that folds the legacy flat keys into the subtree on first load
(`widgetSpotify*` → `nowplaying`), preserving existing values; old flat keys linger
on disk one release (harmless — daemon shallow-merge preserves them).

**`WidgetRegistry.qml`** (singleton) is the hand-written home-widget set — one entry
per widget pairing its `id` + `Component` with its `enabled`/`size`/`order` bindings
(read from `SettingsStore.widget(id)`). Its `widgets` list is sorted by persisted
`order` (so the home column reflects the Widgets-page reorder); `order` is declared
`int` so a no-op recompute is suppressed and an unrelated enable/size toggle does NOT
rebuild the widget set. It is the single place to add a home widget (no codegen — the
repo forbids QML build tooling). The schema-driven **Widgets app** (`shell/widgets/`,
`module shell.widgets`: `WidgetsApp` + `WidgetList` + `WidgetConfig`) renders the
per-widget enable/size/prefs controls + a controller-navigable reorder list from the
manifests; it replaced the old monolithic `components/WidgetsScreen.qml` (which had
itself replaced `settings/WidgetsSettings.qml`).
**`WidgetHost.qml`** instantiates the registry set (Repeater + Loader)
into a `ColumnLayout` and builds the generic vertical focus chain that replaces
HomeScreen's former hand-wired `previousRow`/`nextRow` web: each widget's UP/DOWN
neighbour resolves to the nearest preceding/following focusable widget's
`lastRow`/`firstRow` (or the widget itself if single-stop), falling back to the
host's `topAnchor`/`bottomAnchor` (HomeScreen wires `topAnchor` to the QuickActions
row — also the never-strand focus fallback — and leaves `bottomAnchor` null: the
standalone All Apps tile was removed, so Down off the last widget is a no-op and the
home→Library jump is the Apps widget's "Open Library" chip). HomeScreen attaches
each widget's behaviour via
`widgetHost.widgetById(id)`. The two now-playing renderers are now ONE
`NowPlayingWidget` whose `size` selects a `NowPlayingCard` (medium) or
`NowPlayingStripView` (small) visual leaf; `MediaWidget` is a thin host of the same
`NowPlayingCard` for standalone use (e.g. SessionQAM).

## Key Data Flows

- **Streaming targets**: Loaded from `~/.config/tv-shell/targets.json` at startup (single-line JSON — see gotchas). The path is resolved client-side by the `Paths` QML singleton (`$TV_SHELL_TARGETS` env → else `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/tv-shell/targets.json`); a missing file is a clean no-op (empty target list, no crash). Managed in-UI via MoonlightSettings. Optional `sunshineUser`/`sunshinePass`/`sunshinePort` fields enable pre-flight session detection via the Sunshine API — when present, the shell checks for active sessions before streaming and offers Resume/Quit/Cancel if a different app is running. Credentials should be injected by the deployment system, not committed.
- **Settings persistence**: `~/.config/tv-shell/settings.json` stores `themeMode`, `streamingViewMode`, `controllerDebug`, the per-widget `widgets.<id>.*` subtree (QML-owned) and `keyBindings` (daemon-owned). The **daemon is the sole writer** — `SettingsStore` reads via `get-config` and hands QML-owned keys to `set-config` (read-modify-write), so QML never formats config JSON itself. All QML-side I/O is centralized in the `SettingsStore` singleton — add new settings there (a property + load/save handling), not in Theme.qml. **A new key needs three things, and a test enforces the third**: the `_schema` row in `SettingsStore.qml`, a matching field in the panel's `SCHEMA` (`panel/src/pages/settings.rs`) unless it is `noSave`, and a row in `settings_consumer_table()` (`panel/src/tests.rs`) naming the file that READS it. A key with a rendered control and no consumer fails the suite — that is a control which reports an effect nothing applies, and it had shipped three times before jedwards1230/tv-shell#416. Theme delegates to SettingsStore. Per-widget config is namespaced under `widgets.<id>` and accessed via `SettingsStore.widget(id)` / `setWidget*` (see the Shared Component Library section); on first load a one-shot migrator folds the legacy flat `widget*` keys into that subtree, preserving values.
- **Config locations & paths**: The shell is prefix-agnostic. Per-user config lives under `~/.config/tv-shell/` (`settings.json`, `targets.json`, optional **`config.toml`** — typed per-machine daemon options, read directly by the daemon via `daemon_config.rs`; optional `hyprland-local.conf`); system defaults conventionally under `/etc/tv-shell/`. The install prefix is resolved at runtime — never hardcode `/opt/tv-shell`. Env vars (runtime/session only — **not** per-machine config, which is `config.toml`): `TV_SHELL_DIR` (install root; exported by the session script, also derived from `current_exe`), `TV_SHELL_INPUT_BIN` (override the daemon binary path for the re-exec/dev-override hook; falls back to `$TV_SHELL_DIR/bin/tv-shell-input`), `TV_SHELL_TARGETS` (override the streaming-targets file path), `TV_SHELL_SOCK` (daemon IPC socket). `/opt/tv-shell` survives only as a documented last-ditch fallback in `tv-shell-session.sh` and the daemon's `install_root()`.
- **App discovery & recents**: `AppDiscoveryManager` (apps via `list-apps`) and `RecentsTracker` (`get-recents` / `record-launch`) read JSON straight from the daemon, which owns the `.desktop` scanning (`freedesktop-desktop-entry` crate) and recents file. QML no longer parses `.desktop` files. The QML side talks to the daemon over a native `Quickshell.Io` socket via `SocketClient.qml` — the old per-call `python3 -c` Unix-socket shims were retired.
- **Input daemon IPC**: See [docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md](docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md) for the full protocol specification. QML sends commands via Unix socket; the daemon streams events to subscribers.
- **Input & state**: [docs/INPUT_AND_STATE.md](docs/INPUT_AND_STATE.md) is the canonical reference for the shell's state machine (`idle`/`launching`/`streaming`/`reconnecting`/`appRunning`), focus model, the per-context input-semantics matrix, B/Escape back precedence, and the `intent` control surface. Read it before changing any input/focus/nav code.
- **Settings panels**: SettingsApp uses a Loader to swap between section components. Each section manages its own system calls via `Quickshell.Io.Process`.

## System Integration

| Tool | Used For |
|------|----------|
| input daemon (IPC) | Gamepad grab/release, settings I/O (`get/set-config`), app discovery (`list-apps`), recents (`get/record`), Bluetooth (`bt-*`), network reads (`net-*`), suspend/battery (`power-*`), Hyprland reads (`hypr-active`/`hypr-clients` + `hypr:*` events), Sunshine pre-flight (`sunshine-status`) — see [docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md](docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md) |
| `wpctl` | Audio volume/mute/sink switching (WirePlumber/PipeWire) |
| `nmcli` | WiFi *join* only (`device wifi connect`) — reads go through the daemon's `net-*` IPC |
| `hyprctl` | Monitor mode/scale changes, app launching, reload, one-shot `dispatch` actions — window/client *reads* go through the daemon's `hypr-*` IPC |
| `systemctl` | Reboot/poweroff one-shots — suspend goes through the daemon's `power-suspend` IPC |
| `cec-client` | _retired_ — HDMI-CEC now owned by the daemon's `cec-*` IPC (`cec-rs`/libcec, #94); built only `--features cec`. The `cec-client`/`cec-ctl`/`living-room-cec` QML fallback chain is removed |
| `moonlight` | Game streaming client (`stream`, `list`, `pair`) |

Besides the owner-only Unix-socket IPC, the daemon can expose a **network-facing
control surface** — an HTTP bridge and an MCP server, both opt-in via
`config.toml` (`[http]`/`[mcp]`), sharing one bearer token (`[http].token_file`),
both thin adapters over `daemon/src/bridge_core.rs`. See
[`docs/CONTROL_SURFACE.md`](docs/CONTROL_SURFACE.md) (and the Agent-Native Dev Loop
under Development). The daemon also emits **observability** signals — structured
journald logs (stdout fallback, auto-detected via `JOURNAL_STREAM`, overridable by
`[observability].log_journal`) and Prometheus metrics via an auth-exempt
`GET /metrics` route plus an optional node_exporter textfile writer
(`[observability].metrics_textfile`); full catalogue in
[`docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`](docs/OBSERVABILITY.md).

A third network-facing surface, **`tv-shell-panel`** (`panel/`), is a separate
LAN-only web control panel binary/systemd unit that consumes the Unix-socket
IPC, the HTTP bridge's `/dev/*` routes, and direct `systemctl`/`journalctl`
exec as a recovery tier when the daemon itself is down. See
[`docs/PANEL.md`](docs/PANEL.md).

The table above reflects the deliberate split: the daemon owns all *reads* of
system state (D-Bus, Hyprland IPC, Sunshine), while shell-outs remain only for
write/action commands (`nmcli` join, `wpctl`, `hyprctl dispatch`, `systemctl`).

**Kiosk window model** (one workspace per app — see
[docs/KIOSK_WINDOW_MODEL.md](docs/KIOSK_WINDOW_MODEL.md)): the invariant "exactly
one app window fills the screen; backgrounded apps keep running but never share
it" is **structural**. Each app class owns a Hyprland workspace, assigned by the
daemon's Hyprland actor on `openwindow` (`daemon/src/workspaces.rs`, dispatched
with `movetoworkspacesilent` so assignment can never steal the screen).
Workspace 1 is reserved and left EMPTY for the home screen. Two apps on
different workspaces cannot share a screen, so split view is unrepresentable
rather than prevented.

**Switching is one primitive**: `hyprctl dispatch workspace N`. Launch, resume,
and return-to-home all funnel through `AppLifecycleManager.showWorkspace()` /
`showHome()`, and the decision logic is pure in `components/resumeFocus.js`
(`resolveTarget` → `workspaceSelector` → `verifyLanding`). Verification is one
integer: read `hypr-monitors` and compare `activeWorkspace`. Those two functions
also publish `AppLifecycleManager.displayedWorkspace` — the shell is the only
switcher, so that property is a record of what it told the compositor, not a
guess (the verify probe corrects it from `hypr-monitors` as a self-heal).

**Audio ownership follows workspace ownership.** You hear the workspace on
screen and nothing else: `components/WorkspaceAudioMuter.qml` mutes the PipeWire
playback streams of every app that is not on `displayedWorkspace`, with the
decision pure in `components/audioOwnership.js`. There is **no per-app
allowlist** — adding an app requires no change — and home needs no special case,
since nothing can ever match the reserved empty workspace 1. (The one exempt list,
`SHELL_OWNED_BINARIES`, is the shell's OWN audio — the Settings speaker test's
`pw-play`, which has no window and would be muted as an orphan. Not an app list:
the rule is about apps, and an app is a thing with a window.) Nodes are
attributed to windows by `application.process.binary`, never by pid (Steam's
window pid owns no PipeWire client) and never by `application.name` (which is
`"Steam"` for *both* Big Picture and the Remote Play stream). Full rationale and
the measurements behind it: [docs/KIOSK_WINDOW_MODEL.md](docs/KIOSK_WINDOW_MODEL.md).

**This replaced a focus-based model, and the reason matters.** `dispatch
focuswindow` is a *request a window can decline* — a Steam Remote Play
`streaming_client` window reporting `acceptsInput: false` made the dispatch a
silent no-op and left a live game unreachable. A workspace switch is a
compositor-level operation nothing can refuse. Deleted with it:
`misc:on_focus_under_fullscreen`, `misc:exit_window_retains_fullscreen`, the
daemon's `force_fullscreen`/`enforce_active_fullscreen` backstop and the
`shell-focus` watch channel that gated it, and QML's `fullscreen 0 set`
assertion plus its `hypr-active` verification. With `gaps_in/gaps_out = 0` a
lone tiled window already fills its workspace, so **do not reintroduce
fullscreen assertions** — they are not needed and every past bug on this path
came from one. `windowrule = fullscreen on` and `suppress_event fullscreen
maximize` remain, but only as cosmetic anti-flash/anti-self-resize measures.

The daemon reconciles on every event-socket (re)connect (reading `j/clients` and
parking each mapped window), so a daemon restart repairs the layout rather than
waiting for a reboot.

**Screen ownership is declared, never inferred.** The shell is a
**wlr-layer-shell surface**, so it never appears in Hyprland's `activewindow` —
which keeps naming the last-focused *toplevel* (a backgrounded, still-fullscreen
app) the whole time the shell is on screen. Nothing may ask the compositor "what
is the user looking at?". Instead `shell.qml` owns one predicate,
**`shellOwnsScreen`**, that drives the `PanelWindow`'s `visible` AND its
`WlrLayershell.keyboardFocus` (so "drawn but unfocused" is unrepresentable) and
is pushed to the daemon as **`shell-focus on|off`** (see
[docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md](docs/IPC_PROTOCOL.md)). While the shell owns the screen the
daemon routes the pad to the shell key-map and suppresses follow-focus — the two
remaining consumers that would otherwise act on the stale active window. (A third,
the kiosk fullscreen backstop, was deleted along with the focus-based window model
above; it was the only reader of the `shell-focus` watch channel, which went with
it.) The shell re-asserts it on a ~3s heartbeat, so a missed
edge (an app that closes to background, a timed-out launch, a daemon restart)
self-heals within a tick instead of wedging.

**HDMI-CEC** lives in the daemon (`cec-*` IPC, deployed and verified on gaming-client
with static-linked libcec — no system `libcec`/`libcec-dev` at build or runtime).
CEC startup/wake focus is gated by `cecFocusOnStartup` (default `false`) and
`cecFocusOnWake` (default `true`), both within the `[cec].lifecycle` master gate
(in `config.toml`). The OSD device name the daemon announces (the input label
TVs/AVRs display) is `[cec].osd_name`, defaulting to the machine hostname —
editable from the panel's CEC page. Keep CEC disabled in other CEC-capable apps
(e.g. Plex HTPC) so the daemon stays the box's single CEC owner: the USB adapter
(`/dev/ttyACM0`) takes an **exclusive** serial lock, so whichever process opens it
first owns CEC for its lifetime and the loser just logs `CEC_ALERT_PORT_BUSY` and
retries forever. Two consequences: the AVR/TV input label is whichever owner's OSD
name won the race (the "sometimes tv-shell, sometimes PlexHTPC" swap), and
**restarting the daemon while another CEC app runs hands that app the adapter** —
a deploy is exactly such a restart, so stop the other app first, or expect to
restart the daemon again once it's gone.

### Widget sidecars (remote HTTP backends)

A home-screen widget that needs heavy backend logic ships a **sidecar process**.
`tv-shell-host` (the Steam library/launch backend) is the first and only one
today. It runs on a **different machine** (the gaming PC) and the daemon reaches
it **over HTTP on the LAN** with a bearer token (`[steam]` in `config.toml`) — the
daemon is an HTTP *client*, not a process supervisor: it never spawns,
health-restarts, or otherwise manages the sidecar's lifecycle ("health" =
reachability via `GET /status`). The reusable client plumbing lives in
`daemon/src/sidecar.rs`; the daemon↔sidecar JSON contract is single-sourced in the
`tv-shell-protocol` crate (`LibraryResponse`/`StatusResponse`/`LaunchRequest`/
`SleepResponse`),
(de)serialized by both sides so the wire shape can't drift. See
[docs/HOST_SETUP.md](docs/HOST_SETUP.md).

## Development

No build step — QML is interpreted by Quickshell at runtime. Deploy by syncing files to the target machine's install directory and restarting Quickshell.

### Deploy Cycle

```bash
# 1. Push changes to git
git push origin <branch>

# 2. Pull on target device (install prefix is resolved from $TV_SHELL_DIR /
#    current_exe — $TV_SHELL_DIR below is just whatever prefix you installed to)
ssh <device> "cd \$TV_SHELL_DIR && git pull"

# 3. Restart Quickshell — single-instance safe (#254). Quickshell runs as a
#    `systemd --user` unit, so ALWAYS restart via systemctl (never `killall
#    quickshell` + `&`, which races and stacks 3-4 instances — the #254 foot-gun).
systemctl --user restart tv-shell-quickshell.service
# Fallback for a non-systemd / bare-process session only — exact-match kill,
# verify zero, THEN relaunch (do NOT background a relaunch before the kill settles):
#   pkill -x quickshell; while pgrep -xc quickshell | grep -qv '^0$'; do sleep 0.2; done
#   SIG=$(ls /run/user/1000/hypr/ | tail -1)
#   WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000 \
#     HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE=$SIG quickshell -c tv-shell &
# Automated dev loop: prefer the daemon's `/dev/restart-shell` (HTTP) or MCP
# `restart_shell` — both serialized + single-instance (see docs/CONTROL_SURFACE.md).

# 4. Screenshot for verification
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000 grim /tmp/screenshot.png
```

### Rust Input Daemon

Install the built daemon binary to its resolved location. `build-daemon.sh`
builds `-p tv-shell-input` from the workspace root, so the binary lands at the
**workspace-root** `target/release/` (one shared target dir) — NOT
`daemon/target/release/`:

```bash
install -m755 target/release/tv-shell-input "$TV_SHELL_DIR/bin/tv-shell-input"
```

**HDMI-CEC (`--features cec`) and the MCP server (`--features mcp`) are opt-in features.** A plain `cargo build` is C-free; the `cec` feature pulls in `cec-rs`/`libcec-sys` and **static-links a bundled libcec** — a prebuilt static libcec + p8-platform is fetched from ssalonen/libcec-static-builds and linked into the binary, so the daemon needs **no system `libcec`/`libcec-dev`** at build or runtime. The static path needs no bindgen/cmake/clang — only `libudev-dev` + `pkg-config` and network at build time to fetch the archive.

Requires Linux with evdev and uinput access. Auto-discovers gamepad by vendor/product ID (defaults: Xbox controller `045e:028e`, configurable via `GAMEPAD_VENDOR`/`GAMEPAD_PRODUCT` env vars). The Linux-only evdev/uinput/D-Bus modules build only on the target (or CI); the cross-platform subset (`protocol`, `config`, `state`, `device` GUID math, `apps`, `health`, `recents`) builds and tests on any host.

### Agent-Native Dev Loop

The daemon is built so an LLM agent can drive the **entire** dev/verify loop with
no human in the pixel-path. The daemon exposes its control surface over the network
two ways — a hand-rolled HTTP bridge and an official MCP server — both opt-in, both
documented in [`docs/CONTROL_SURFACE.md`](docs/CONTROL_SURFACE.md). The MCP server
makes the shell **drivable and observable as MCP tools**, so an agent runs a full
**observe → act → verify** loop:

1. `dev_deploy <ref>` → `dev_build` → `dev_restart_daemon` / `restart_shell` — pull a branch and rebuild on-device.
2. `send_intent` / `navigate` / `open_settings` / `launch_app` — drive the UI.
3. `take_screenshot` — **see** the result; `get_status` / `get_logs` — diagnose.
4. Compare against intent, repeat.

Enable on the deploy host in `~/.config/tv-shell/config.toml`: set `[mcp].bind`
(+ `[http].token_file` pointing at a 0600 token file), and `[mcp].dev = true` for
the deploy/build/restart tools. Point an MCP client at `http://<host>/mcp`. Note
the daemon REFUSES to start with a non-loopback bind + dev tools + auth-off
unless `[dev].allow_insecure_lan = true` (the intentional opt-in for a trusted
single-user LAN host). This is the in-repo, distribution-agnostic version of the external
screenshot/deploy automation — no host-management tooling required.

## Design Constraints

- **10-foot UI at 4K**: All font sizes and layout constants in Theme.qml are sized for couch-distance reading. Don't shrink them.
- **Controller-first navigation**: Every interactive element must be reachable via D-pad (arrow keys) and activatable with A (Enter). B (Escape) always goes back. Focus management is critical — use `KeyNavigation` chains and `Keys.on*Pressed` handlers.
- **Palette rules**: See `config/palette.md`. Never use gold for text. Crimson for focus/active states. Ember for secondary interactive elements. All overlay backdrops use `Qt.rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7-0.85)`.
- **No build tooling — in v1's `shell/`**: No bundler, no compiler, no package manager for QML there. Files are deployed as-is, which is what makes v1's `git pull` + `systemctl --user restart` deploy cycle possible, and it stays true for as long as `shell/` boots the couch. **It does not hold for `shell-v2/`**, which has a CMake build and ships a compiled binary with its QML embedded. That reversal is deliberate and unavoidable rather than a regression, and it is measured rather than argued: gamescope resolves a window's app id at **creation** and never re-reads it, so post-map tagging does not work (bench 2026-09-06 on the pinned gamescope 3.16.28, plus a live control 2026-09-07 — [`docs/V2_SHELL.md`](docs/V2_SHELL.md) §8a). The v2 shell must therefore set X11 properties on its own toplevels *before they map* (`docs/V2_DESIGN.md` §5); QML cannot issue `XChangeProperty` and Qt exposes no virtual hook between window creation and map, so a C++ type is required and a build step follows. §13 Q1 anticipated it ("a C++ helper or plugin"). The consequence — v2's shell is **not** rsync-deployable, so a `git pull` on the device changes nothing until it is built there or a built artifact is shipped — is spelled out, and left unsolved, in [`docs/V2_SHELL.md`](docs/V2_SHELL.md) §9.
- **Site-neutral, not OS-neutral**: no deployment's hostnames, IPs, MACs or device identities appear in a non-test source path — AV endpoints, node addresses and the panel's deployment target are all configuration (`docs/PRD.md` §4 goal 8, §5). Nothing here depends on a particular configuration-management tool. It does **not** mean platform-agnostic: the panel's recovery tier is systemd-specific (`systemctl`/`journalctl`) and its system-update tier is pacman-specific (`checkupdates`, `sudo -n pacman -Syu`), both by design. The QML shell itself runs on any Linux system with Hyprland + Quickshell. `scripts/check-site-identity.py` enforces the site-neutral half in CI, on every PR.

## Gotchas

- **SplitParser reads line-by-line**: Any JSON loaded via `cat` + `SplitParser` must be single-line. Never pretty-print `targets.json` or `settings.json`.
- **Theme.qml is an Item, not QtObject**: Quickshell 0.3.0 can't host Process/Timer children inside QtObject. The singleton uses Item as its root type.
- **`image://icon/` for Freedesktop icons**: Use `Image { source: "image://icon/" + iconName }` to load icons from the system theme. Falls back to nothing if the icon doesn't exist — provide a letter-initial fallback.
- **qmldir must list new components**: Quickshell won't auto-discover them. Add a line like `MyComponent 1.0 MyComponent.qml`. There are **ten** registries — flat components go in `components/qmldir` (`module components`); shared library components go in `components/lib/qmldir` (`module components.lib`); settings pages go in `settings/qmldir` (`module shell.settings`); the Widgets app's parts go in `widgets/qmldir` (`module shell.widgets`); the widget framework (Widget/WidgetHost/WidgetRegistry/WidgetManifests/FilterChips) goes in `widgets/lib/qmldir` (`module shell.widgets.lib`); the shared Steam library view goes in `widgets/steamlib/qmldir` (`module shell.widgets.steamlib`); and each home-widget family owns its own dir + qmldir — `widgets/moonlight/` (`module shell.widgets.moonlight`), `widgets/nowplaying/` (`module shell.widgets.nowplaying`), `widgets/plex/` (`module shell.widgets.plex`), `widgets/apps/` (`module shell.widgets.apps`). Cross-module reach uses relative-dir imports of the target directory's qmldir: a `lib/` file uses `import "../"` to see parent singletons; a page uses `import "lib"` for library types; a **settings or widgets page** uses `import "../components"` (singletons/atoms) + `import "../components/lib"` (lib types). All are the same mechanism — a relative directory import pulls that dir's qmldir types into bare scope (see [Shared Component Library](#shared-component-library-lib)).
- **WAYLAND_DISPLAY may vary**: Usually `wayland-1` but try `wayland-0` if grim/hyprctl fails.
- **Hyprland instance signature**: Multiple instances may exist in `/run/user/1000/hypr/`; use `tail -1` for the latest.
- **Theme property renames cascade**: `Theme.text` → `Theme.textPrimary` will also hit `Theme.textDim` producing `Theme.textPrimaryDim`. Replace longest matches first.

## CI

- **Orchestrator + single required check (`ci.yml`)**: there is ONE umbrella workflow, `ci.yml`, with no path filter — it runs on every PR (and push to main) so it always reports. A `changes` job (`dorny/paths-filter`) detects which areas changed; each area runs as a **reusable workflow** (`on: workflow_call`) invoked only when its area changed; a final **`ci-gate`** job aggregates results (skipped area = success). **Mark only `CI / ci-gate` as the required status check** — path-filtered workflows can't be required directly (a PR not touching their paths would leave the check "waiting" forever and be unmergeable). To add an area: add a `dorny` filter + a conditional `uses:` job in `ci.yml` and wire it into `ci-gate`'s `needs`.
- **QML formatting** (`lint.yml`, reusable): `qmlformat` (Qt 6.8). On PRs, unformatted files are auto-fixed and pushed (needs `contents: write` + `secrets: inherit`, passed by `ci.yml`). On main, unformatted files fail the check.
- **Rust CI** (`rust.yml` / `host.yml`, reusable): `rust.yml` runs four jobs — the daemon (`tv-shell-input`) build/lint/test on Linux, a `--features cec` leg (static-libcec, on `rust:1-trixie`), a separate `panel` job that builds/lints/tests `tv-shell-panel` (pure-Rust, no system C deps), and a `core` job that does the same for `tv-shell-core` (also pure-Rust — `x11rb` needs no libxcb/libX11). `host.yml` builds/lints/tests the cross-platform host + protocol crates on Linux/macOS/Windows. All stay `-p`-scoped so no crate's graph leaks into another's build; `ci.yml`'s `rust` change filter covers `daemon/`, `panel/`, `protocol/`, and `core/`, so a QML-only PR triggers neither `rust.yml` nor `host.yml`.
- **MQTT integration** (`mqtt.yml`, reusable): brings up mosquitto from the committed `dev/mqtt/compose.yaml` and runs `host/tests/mqtt_broker.rs` against it — the I/O glue (topic names, retain flags, discovery shape, state envelope, heartbeat, Last Will on an ungraceful kill) that the 26 pure-function MQTT unit tests deliberately don't reach. `#[ignore]`-gated behind `TV_SHELL_TEST_BROKER` so `cargo test` stays offline; **not** `cfg(target_os)`-gated, so the file stays compiled + clippy-clean on `host.yml`'s three targets. See [docs/MQTT.md](docs/MQTT.md#testing).
- **Headless QML tests** (`qml-test.yml`, reusable): `qmltestrunner` under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` runs the layout/navigation suite in `tests/qml/` (see `tests/qml/README.md`).
- **gamescope kit fixture** (`gamescope.yml`, reusable): shellchecks `dev/gamescope/` and runs `dev/gamescope/tests/run.sh` (57 assertions) + `run-steam.sh` (69 assertions) against a **fake X display and fake clients** — no gamescope, no Steam, no Moonlight, no network, no display server, so it runs on a stock runner in seconds. It guards the kit's decision logic: pid→xid tagging, the Sunshine pre-flight, the Steam class-family walk, and the `env(1)` argument ordering the Steam verbs depend on (every `-u NAME` must precede any `NAME=VALUE`, or `env` runs the `-u` as the command). See `dev/gamescope/tests/README.md`.
- **Releases — three independent streams**: each artifact is versioned independently within the one monorepo, so the release trigger has to say *which* artifact to cut. The binary streams are **opt-in via a component-scoped label on the merged PR**; the widget stream stays tag-driven (a label can't carry the widget id).
  - `semver:host:patch|minor|major` → `release-host.yml` tags `host-v<semver>` and builds `tv-shell-host` for linux-musl / macOS (arm64+x86_64) / windows, publishing one Release with all binaries + `checksums.txt`. Consumed by the homelab `desktop-common` Ansible role (`install_method: fetch`).
  - `semver:input:patch|minor|major` → `release-input.yml` tags `input-v<semver>` and builds `tv-shell-input` (`--features cec,mcp`, linux-gnu), publishing its binary + `checksums.txt`.
  - `widget-<id>-v<semver>` **tag push** → `release-widget.yml` publishes a notes-only GitHub Release for the named widget. No binary is built — QML is interpreted at runtime. The workflow validates that `<id>` exists in `widgets-index.json` and that `<semver>` matches its recorded version before publishing. Example: `widget-moonlight-v1.1.0`.

  The two binary streams delegate version compute, tagging, and **AI release notes** to the shared `ai-release.yml@v1` reusable, each called with its own `tag_prefix` (`host-` / `input-`) so it only ever reads and writes that artifact's tag series. **No label → no release**, so chore merges make no noise; a `semver:host:*` label never cuts a daemon release and vice versa. Both also accept a manual `workflow_dispatch` (with `dry_run` to preview the version + notes). Do **not** hand-push a `host-v*` / `input-v*` tag any more — the reusable owns those tags. The scoped labels are this repo's necessary variation on the org's flat `semver:*` convention; the widget stream remains a documented deviation.

  **The tag is the version.** Each binary workflow stamps the computed tag version into its own crate's `Cargo.toml` between the tag checkout and `cargo build`, then verifies the stamp landed — so `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` (`GET /status`, the MQTT state payloads, the HA `host_version`/`daemon_version` diagnostic entities, `build-info`, the MCP server version) is the real release version. It is stamped into the manifest rather than injected as a build env var precisely because cargo's fingerprint covers the package version, so a `rust-cache` hit can't serve an artifact carrying the previous one. The committed `version` in `host/`(`0.6.0`) and `daemon/`(`0.2.2`) tracks the last released tag as a floor for local/dev builds — bumping it releases nothing. `protocol` and `panel` sit at `0.0.0`: no tag series, and nothing reports their version.

- **v2 shell** (`shell-v2.yml`, reusable): CMake-builds `shell-v2/`, runs the module-resolving `all_qmllint` target, and runs three ctest lanes — `surfacetags` (pure C++, no display), `qml` (the real `TvShell` module offscreen), and `premap` (a real `Xvfb`, asserting the `STEAM_*` `PropertyNotify` arrives BEFORE `MapNotify`). The `premap` lane is opt-in behind `TV_SHELL_TEST_XVFB` the way `core/`'s X tests are, and **this workflow sets it**; a dedicated step then asserts all three lanes were registered, because jedwards1230/tv-shell#469 was exactly a gated leg wired to nothing. `shell-v2/**` is its own `ci.yml` area — unlike v1's `qml` area it BUILDS, so it cannot ride inside `qml-test.yml`.
- **Widget index consistency** (`widgets.yml`, reusable): `scripts/check-widgets-index.py` asserts that `widgets-index.json` is in-sync with `shell/widgets/lib/WidgetManifests.qml`. **`WidgetManifests.qml` is the authoring SSOT** — update it first, then update `widgets-index.json` to match. The check runs in CI whenever either file (or the script itself) changes; a drift fails the check and blocks merge. A PR that doesn't touch either file skips the check (no wedging). To push a widget release tag: bump `version` in both files, merge to main, then push `widget-<id>-v<X.Y.Z>`.
